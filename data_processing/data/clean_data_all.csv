"N            2            -fixing proteobacteria (α and γ) and unicellular cyanobacteria are common in both the tropical North Atlantic and Pacific oceans. In near-surface waters proteobacterial            nifH            transcripts were present during both night and day while unicellular cyanobacterial            nifH            transcripts were present during the nighttime only, suggesting separation of N            2            fixation and photosynthesis by unicellular cyanobacteria. Phylogenetic relationships among unicellular cyanobacteria from both oceans were determined after sequencing of a conserved region of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) of cyanobacteria, and results showed that they clustered together, regardless of the ocean of origin. However, sequencing of            nifH            transcripts of unicellular cyanobacteria from both oceans showed that they clustered separately. This suggests that unicellular cyanobacteria from the tropical North Atlantic and subtropical North Pacific share a common ancestry (16S rDNA) and that potential unicellular N            2            fixers have diverged (            nifH            ). N            2            fixation rates for unicellular bacterioplankton (including small cyanobacteria) from both oceans were determined in situ according to the acetylene reduction and            15            N            2            protocols. The results showed that rates of fixation by bacterioplankton can be almost as high as those of fixation by the colonial N            2            -fixing marine cyanobacteria            Trichodesmium            spp. in the tropical North Atlantic but that rates are much lower in the subtropical North Pacific.","['Douglas G.

". We have determined the latitudinal distribution of Trichodesmium spp. abundance and community N2 fixation in the Atlantic Ocean along a meridional transect from ca. 30° N to 30° S in November–December 2007 and April–May 2008. The observations from both cruises were highly consistent in terms of absolute magnitude and latitudinal distribution, showing a strong association between Trichodesmium abundance and community N2 fixation. The highest Trichodesmium abundances (mean = 220 trichomes L−1,) and community N2 fixation rates (mean = 60 μmol m−2 d−1) occurred in the Equatorial region between 5° S–15° N. In the South Atlantic gyre, Trichodesmium abundance was very low (ca. 1 trichome L−1) but N2 fixation was always measurable, averaging 3 and 10 μmol m2 d−1 in 2007 and 2008, respectively. We suggest that N2 fixation in the South Atlantic was sustained by other, presumably unicellular, diazotrophs. Comparing these distributions with the geographical pattern in atmospheric dust deposition points to iron supply as the main factor determining the large scale latitudinal variability of Trichodesmium spp. abundance and N2 fixation in the Atlantic Ocean. We observed a marked South to North decrease in surface phosphate concentration, which argues against a role for phosphorus availability in controlling the large scale distribution of N2 fixation. Scaling up from all our measurements (42 stations) results in conservative estimates for total N2 fixation of ∼6 TgN yr−1 in the North Atlantic (0–40° N) and ~1.2 TgN yr−1 in the South Atlantic (0–40° S).","['E.

". The Bay of Bengal (BoB) has long stood as a biogeochemical enigma, withsubsurface waters containing extremely low, but persistent, concentrationsof oxygen in the nanomolar range which – for some, yet unconstrained, reason –are prevented from becoming anoxic. One reason for this may be the lowproductivity of the BoB waters due to nutrient limitation and the resultinglack of respiration of organic material at intermediate waters. Thus, theparameters determining primary production are key in understanding whatprevents the BoB from developing anoxia. Primary productivity in the sunlitsurface layers of tropical oceans is mostly limited by the supply ofreactive nitrogen through upwelling, riverine flux, atmospheric deposition,and biological dinitrogen (N2) fixation. In the BoB, a stablestratification limits nutrient supply via upwelling in the open waters, andriverine or atmospheric fluxes have been shown to support only less than one-quarter of the nitrogen for primary production. This leaves a largeuncertainty for most of the BoB's nitrogen input, suggesting a potentialrole of N2 fixation in those waters. Here, we present a survey of N2 fixation and carbon fixation in the BoBduring the winter monsoon season. We detected a community of N2 fixerscomparable to other oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) regions, with only a fewcyanobacterial clades and a broad diversity of non-phototrophic N2fixers present throughout the water column (samples collected between 10and 560 m water depth). While similar communities of N2 fixers wereshown to actively fix N2 in other OMZs, N2 fixation rates werebelow the detection limit in our samples covering the water column betweenthe deep chlorophyll maximum and the OMZ. Consistent with this, no N2fixation signal was visible in δ15N signatures. We suggest thatthe absence of N2 fixation may be a consequence of a micronutrientlimitation or of an O2 sensitivity of the OMZ diazotrophs in the BoB.Exploring how the onset of N2 fixation by cyanobacteria compared tonon-phototrophic N2 fixers would impact on OMZ O2 concentrations,a simple model exercise was carried out. We observed that both photic-zone-based and OMZ-based N2 fixation are very sensitive to evenminimal changes in water column stratification, with stronger mixingincreasing organic matter production and export, which can exhaustremaining O2 traces in the BoB.","['Don Canfield', 'Hermann W.

"[1] The Bay of Bengal is traditionally considered to be a less productive basin compared to the Arabian Sea. We explore the reasons for this in the central Bay during summer. Copious rainfall and river water freshen the upper layers of the Bay by 3–7 psu during summer, and SST was warmer by 1.5–2°C than in the central Arabian Sea. This leads to a strongly stratified surface layer. The weaker winds over the Bay are unable to erode the strongly stratified surface layer, thereby restricting the turbulent wind-driven vertical mixing to a shallow depth of <20 m. This inhibits introduction of nutrients from below, situated close to the mixed layer bottom, into the upper layers. While advection of nutrients rich water into the euphotic zone makes the Arabian Sea highly productive, this process is unlikely in the Bay of Bengal.","['M. Madhupratap', 'S. Sardesai', 'S.

The N 2 fixation rates vary from 0.1 to 34 mmol N m -2d -1 after correcting for the isotopic under-equilibrium with dissolved air in the samples. These higher N 2 fixation rates are consistent with higher chlorophyll a and low I´ 15N of natural particulate organic nitrogen.

Phosphate was detectable at the surface throughout the study area. The dissolved iron concentration and the ratio of iron to nitrate + nitrite at the surface were significantly higher in the Arabian Sea than in the equatorial and southern Indian Ocean. Nitrogen fixation in the Arabian Sea (24.6–47.1 μmolN m−2 d−1) was also significantly greater than that in the equatorial and southern Indian Ocean (6.27–16.6 μmolN m−2 d−1), indicating that iron could control diazotrophy in the Indian Ocean. Phylogenetic analysis of nifH showed that most diazotrophs belonged to the Proteobacteria and that cyanobacterial diazotrophs were absent in the study area except in the Arabian Sea. Furthermore, nitrogen fixation was not associated with light intensity throughout the study area. These results are consistent with nitrogen fixation in the Indian Ocean, being largely performed by heterotrophic bacteria and not by cyanobacteria. The low cyanobacterial diazotrophy was attributed to the shallow nitracline, which is rarely observed in the Pacific and Atlantic oligotrophic oceans. Because the shallower nitracline favored enhanced upward nitrate flux, the competitive advantage of cyanobacterial diazotrophs over nondiazotrophic phytoplankton was not as significant as it is in other oligotrophic oceans.","['Ken Furuya', 'Shigenobu Takeda', 'Taketoshi Kodama', 'Minoru Ijichi', 'Takuhei Shiozaki']",10.1002/2014GB004886,https://doi.org/10.1002/2014GB004886,0,0,Heterotrophic bacteria as major nitrogen fixers in the euphotic zone of the Indian Ocean: NITROGEN FIXATION IN THE INDIAN OCEAN,Global Biogeochemical Cycles,,"['Biology', 'Geology']",Oceanography

"[1] The broad distribution and often high densities of the cyanobacterium Trichodesmium spp. in oligotrophic waters imply a substantial role for this one taxon in the oceanic N cycle of the marine tropics and subtropics. New results from 154 stations on six research cruises in the North Atlantic Ocean show depth-integrated N2 fixation by Trichodesmium spp. at many stations that equalled or exceeded the estimated vertical flux of NO3− into the euphotic zone by diapycnal mixing. Areal rates are consistent with those derived from several indirect geochemical analyses. Direct measurements of N2 fixation rates by Trichodesmium are also congruent with upper water column N budgets derived from parallel determinations of stable isotope distributions, clearly showing that N2 fixation by Trichodesmium is a major source of new nitrogen in the tropical North Atlantic. We project a conservative estimate of the annual input of new N into the tropical North Atlantic of at least 1.6 × 1012 mol N by Trichodesmium N2 fixation alone. This input can account for a substantial fraction of the N2 fixation in the North Atlantic inferred by several of the geochemical approaches.","['Edward J. Carpenter', 'Anthony F.

"In this paper, we present a system to compensate for the light deflection effect during the optical geometry measurement of a wrought-hot object. The acquired 3D data can be used to analyze the formed geometry of a component directly after a hot forging process without waiting for the needed cooling time to room temperature. This may be used to parameterize the process and to detect defect components early in the production process, among others. The light deflection as the deviation from the linear path of the light is caused by an inhomogeneous refractive index field surrounding the hot object. We present the design and setup for a nozzle-based forced air flow actuator, which suppresses the light deflection effect. The design process includes a simulation of the developing field, as well as of the interaction of the field with an external forced air flow. The cooling effect of the air flow is evaluated, and conclusions are drawn from the conflicting interests of good measurement conditions against the forced cooling of the hot object. The findings are then implemented in the physical setup of the suppression system. The system is evaluated using a previously established method based on optical triangulation and fringe projection. Other occurring effects and their influence on the evaluation are considered and discussed.","['Eduard Reithmeier', 'Markus Kästner', 'Rüdiger Beermann', 'Carl Reinke', 'Lorenz Quentin']",10.3390/met10070908,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/met10070908,7,2020,"Design, Setup, and Evaluation of a Compensation System for the Light Deflection Effect Occurring When Measuring Wrought-Hot Objects Using Optical Triangulation Methods",Metals,"(['General Materials Science', 'Metals and Alloys'],)",,Optics

"In a world where resources are scarce and urban areas consume the vast majority of these resources, it is vital to make cities greener and more sustainable. Advanced systems to improve and automate processes within a city will play a leading role in smart cities. From smart design of buildings, which capture rain water for later use, to intelligent control systems, which can monitor infrastructures autonomously, the possible improvements enabled by sensing technologies are immense. Ubiquitous sensing poses numerous challenges, which are of a technological or social nature. This paper presents an overview of the state of the art with regards to sensing in smart cities. Topics include sensing applications in smart cities, sensing platforms and technical challenges associated with these technologies. In an effort to provide a holistic view of how sensing technologies play a role in smart cities, a range of applications and technical challenges associated with these applications are discussed. As some of these applications and technologies belong to different disciplines, the material presented in this paper attempts to bridge these to provide a broad overview, which can be of help to researchers and developers in understanding how advanced sensing can play a role in smart cities.","['G P Hancke', 'B De Carvalho E Silva', 'G P Hancke']",10.3390/s130100393,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/db4a2a533a2236845a2b84c8317854179db6e7eb,0,2013,The Role of Advanced Sensing in Smart Cities,Sensors,,"['Engineering', 'Computer Science', 'Medicine']",Computer Sciences

"The computationally sound proof (CS proof) is a proof system which reduces the verifier’s computation to a level polylogarithmic in that of accepting. If used in cloud computing, CS proof will significantly reduce computation of the client whose computation resources are much more limited than that of the cloud server. We are the first to introduce CS proof belonging to complexity theory into cloud computing, where a protocol for data integrity verification is proposed to reduce the customer’s computation. Concretely, the customer’s computation is only poly-logarithmic in that of the traditional protocols. However, in our opinion, the significance of this study is not the improved efficiency, but that we introduce a new way to achieve integrity verification. The proposed protocol supports public verification even without the customer’s public key and satisfies the security against semi-honest adversaries. The customer’s privacy holds against both the cloud and the third-party verifier. The proposed protocol can be considered as a proper application of CS proof to integrity verification in cloud computing.","[' Yang, Bo', 'Shao, Zhi Yi']",10.1504/IJES.2015.072365,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f8753a38a3c499d2612b65f7185280110043a465,0,0,Proof of Retrievability with Efficient Verification,Int.

"Remote data auditing service is important for mobile clients to guarantee the intactness of their outsourced data stored at cloud side. To relieve mobile client from the nonnegligible burden incurred by performing the frequent data auditing, more and more literatures propose that the execution of such data auditing should be migrated from mobile client to third-party auditor (TPA). However, existing public auditing schemes always assume that TPA is reliable, which is the potential risk for outsourced data security. Although Outsourced Proofs of Retrievability (OPOR) have been proposed to further protect against the malicious TPA and collusion among any two entities, the original OPOR scheme applies only to the static data, which is the limitation that should be solved for enabling data dynamics. In this paper, we design a novel authenticated data structure called bv23Tree, which enables client to batch-verify the indices and values of any number of appointed leaves all at once for efficiency. By utilizing bv23Tree and a hierarchical storage structure, we present the first solution for Dynamic OPOR (DOPOR), which extends the OPOR model to support dynamic updates of the outsourced data. Extensive security and performance analyses show the reliability and effectiveness of our proposed scheme.","[' Xiao, Jia', ' Wen, Qiaoyan', ' Zhang, Hua', ' Tu, Tengfei', 'Rao, Lu']",10.1155/2018/4186243,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/4186243,0,0,Dynamic Outsourced Proofs of Retrievability Enabling Auditing Migration for Remote Storage Security,['Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing'],"(['Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Computer Networks and Communications', 'Information Systems'],)",,Engineering

"In this paper, we define and explore proofs of retrievability (PORs). A POR scheme enables an archive or back-up service (prover) to produce a concise proof that a user (verifier) can retrieve a target file F, that is, that the archive retains and reliably transmits file data sufficient for the user to recover F in its entirety. A POR may be viewed as a kind of cryptographic proof of knowledge (POK), but one specially designed to handle a large file (or bitstring) F. We explore POR protocols here in which the communication costs, number of memory accesses for the prover, and storage requirements of the user (verifier) are small parameters essentially independent of the length of F. In addition to proposing new, practical POR constructions, we explore implementation considerations and optimizations that bear on previously explored, related schemes. In a POR, unlike a POK, neither the prover nor the verifier need actually have knowledge of F. PORs give rise to a new and unusual security definition whose formulation is another contribution of our work. We view PORs as an important tool for semi-trusted online archives. Existing cryptographic techniques help users ensure the privacy and integrity of files they retrieve. It is also natural, however, for users to want to verify that archives do not delete or modify files prior to retrieval. The goal of a POR is to accomplish these checks without users having to download the files themselves. A POR can also provide quality-of-service guarantees, i.e., show that a file is retrievable within a certain time bound.","[' Kaliski, Burton S.', 'Juels, Ari']",10.1145/1315245.1315317,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d17a819dbd6a6c104d41125fb9edf9f9e11e0a4a,0,0,Pors: Proofs of Retrievability for Large Files,CCS '07,,['Computer Science'],Computer Sciences

"We consider the problem of efficiently proving the integrity of data stored at untrusted servers. In the provable data possession (PDP) model, the client preprocesses the data and then sends it to an untrusted server for storage, while keeping a small amount of meta-data. The client later asks the server to prove that the stored data has not been tampered with or deleted (without downloading the actual data). However, the original PDP scheme applies only to static (or append-only) files. We present a definitional framework and efficient constructions for dynamic provable data possession (DPDP), which extends the PDP model to support provable updates to stored data. We use a new version of authenticated dictionaries based on rank information. The price of dynamic updates is a performance change from O(1) to O(logn) (or O(nεlog n), for a file consisting of n blocks, while maintaining the same (or better, respectively) probability of misbehavior detection. Our experiments show that this slowdown is very low in practice (e.g. 415KB proof size and 30ms computational overhead for a 1GB file). We also show how to apply our DPDP scheme to outsourced file systems and version control systems (e.g. CVS).","[' Tamassia, Roberto', ' Papamanthou, Charalampos', ' Kupcu, Alptekin', 'Erway, C.

"A proof of retrievability (POR) is a compact proof by a file system (prover) to a client (verifier) that a target file F is intact, in the sense that the client can fully recover it. As PORs incur lower communication complexity than transmission of F itself, they are an attractive building block for high-assurance remote storage systems. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework for the design of PORs. Our framework improves the previously proposed POR constructions of Juels-Kaliski and Shacham-Waters, and also sheds light on the conceptual limitations of previous theoretical models for PORs. It supports a fully Byzantine adversarial model, carrying only the restriction---fundamental to all PORs---that the adversary's error rate be bounded when the client seeks to extract F. We propose a new variant on the Juels-Kaliski protocol and describe a prototype implementation. We demonstrate practical encoding even for files F whose size exceeds that of client main memory.","[' Oprea, Alina', ' Juels, Ari', 'Bowers, Kevin D.']",10.1145/1655008.1655015,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9411ddb9b86ad4879c0932fa6260c57e7a7cfb21,0,0,Proofs of Retrievability: Theory and Implementation,CCSW '09,,['Computer Science'],Computer Sciences

"Proofs of Retrievability (PoRs) are protocols which allow a client to store data remotely and to efficiently ensure, via audits, that the entirety of that data is still intact. A dynamic PoR system also supports efficient retrieval and update of any small portion of the data. We propose new, simple protocols for dynamic PoR that are designed for practical efficiency, trading decreased persistent storage for increased server computation, and show in fact that this tradeoff is inherent via a lower bound proof of time-space for any PoR scheme. Notably, ours is the first dynamic PoR which does not require any special encoding of the data stored on the server, meaning it can be trivially composed with any database service or with existing techniques for encryption or redundancy. Our implementation and deployment on Google Cloud Platform demonstrates our solution is scalable: for example, auditing a 1TB file takes 16 minutes at a monetary cost of just $0.23 USD. We also present several further enhancements, reducing the amount of client storage, or the communication bandwidth, or allowing public verifiability, wherein any untrusted third party may conduct an audit.

"In recent years, social movement scholars have shown increasing interest in the internal lives of social movements, but this turn from “social movements as actors” to “social movements as spaces” has not yet led to a conceptual apparatus that addresses the key role of face-to-face meetings, especially in the inter-organizational domain of mesomobilization. Building on the concept of “partial organization”, the paper develops the concept of “meeting arena” as a hybrid of three forms of social order: organization, institution, and network. It is argued that the complex figuration of meeting arenas in a social movement or protest mobilization constitutes an infrastructure that synchronizes the dispersed activities of movement actors in time and space. This infrastructure is not an entirely emergent phenomenon but is also the result of conscious decisions by organizers. Heuristic, methodological, and theoretical implications of this novel perspective on social movements are discussed, highlighting especially the potential of the distinction between organizing and mobilizing as two intertwined but essentially different types of social movement activity.",Christoph Haug,10.1177/0170840613479232,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0170840613479232,5,2013,"Organizing Spaces: Meeting Arenas as a Social Movement Infrastructure between Organization, Network, and Institution",Organization Studies,"(['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Strategy and Management'],)",,Science

"As part of a data mining competition, a training and test set of laboratory test data about patients with and without surgical site infection (SSI) were provided. The task was to develop predictive models with training set and identify patients with SSI in the no label test set. Lab test results are vital resources that guide healthcare providers make decisions about all aspects of surgical patient management. Many machine learning models were developed after pre-processing and imputing the lab tests data and only the top performing methods are discussed. Overall, RANDOM FOREST algorithms performed better than Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression. Using a set of 74 lab tests, with RF, there were only 4 false positives in the training set and predicted 35 out of 50 SSI patients in the test set (Accuracy 0.86, Sensitivity 0.68, and Specificity 0.91). Optimal ways to address healthcare data quality concerns and imputation methods as well as newer generalizable algorithms need to be explored further to decipher new associations and knowledge among laboratory biomarkers and SSI.","Prabhu RV Shankar, Anupama  Kesari, Priya  Shalini, N  Kamalashree, Charan  Bharadwaj, Nitika  Raj, Sowrabha  Srinivas, Manu  Shivakumar, Anand Raj Ulle , Nagabhushana N Tagadur",10.4018/978-1-7998-1204-3.ch022,http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/978-1-7998-1204-3.ch022,0,0,Predictive Modeling of Surgical Site Infections Using Sparse Laboratory Data,['Data Analytics in Medicine'],"([],)",,Science

"A large fraction of the electronic health records consists of clinical measurements collected over time, such as blood tests, which provide important information about the health status of a patient. These sequences of clinical measurements are naturally represented as time series, characterized by multiple variables and the presence of missing data, which complicate analysis. In this work, we propose a surgical site infection detection framework for patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery that is completely unsupervised, hence alleviating the problem of getting access to labelled training data. The framework is based on powerful kernels for multivariate time series that account for missing data when computing similarities. Our approach show superior performance compared to baselines that have to resort to imputation techniques and performs comparable to a supervised classification baseline.

"This study describes a novel approach to solve the surgical site infection (SSI) classification problem. Feature engineering has traditionally been one of the most important steps in solving complex classification problems, especially in cases with temporal data. The described novel approach is based on ion of temporal data recorded in three temporal windows. Maximum likelihood L1-norm (lasso) regularization was used in penalized logistic regression to predict the onset of surgical site infection occurrence based on available patient blood testing results up to the day of surgery. Prior knowledge of predictors (blood tests) was integrated in the modelling by introduction of penalty factors depending on blood test prices and an early stopping parameter limiting the maximum number of selected features used in predictive modelling. Finally, solutions resulting in higher interpretability and cost-effectiveness were demonstrated. Using repeated holdout cross-validation, the baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) classifier achieved a mean AUC of 0.801, whereas our best full lasso model achieved a mean AUC of 0.956. Best model testing results were achieved for full lasso model with maximum number of features limited at 20 features with an AUC of 0.967. Presented models showed the potential to not only support domain experts in their decision making but could also prove invaluable for improvement in prediction of SSI occurrence, which may even help setting new guidelines in the field of preoperative SSI prevention and surveillance.","Primoz Kocbek, Nino Fijacko, Cristina Soguero-Ruiz, Karl Oyvind Mikalsen, Uros Maver, Petra Povalej Brzan, Andraz Stozer, Robert Jenssen, Stein Olav Skrovseth , Gregor Stiglic",10.1155/2019/2059851,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/2059851,0,0,Maximizing Interpretability and Cost-Effectiveness of Surgical Site Infection (SSI) Predictive Models Using Feature-Specific Regularized Logistic Regression on Preoperative Temporal Data,['Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine'],"(['Applied Mathematics', 'General Immunology and Microbiology', 'General Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology', 'Modelling and Simulation', 'General Medicine'],)",,Biochemistry

"The National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (NSQIP) is widely recognized as “the best in the nation” surgical quality improvement resource in the United States. In particular, it rigorously defines postoperative morbidity outcomes, including surgical adverse events occurring within 30 days of surgery. Due to its manual yet expensive construction process, the NSQIP registry is of exceptionally high quality, but its high cost remains a significant bottleneck to NSQIP’s wider dissemination. In this work, we propose an automated surgical adverse events detection tool, aimed at accelerating the process of extracting postoperative outcomes from medical charts. As a prototype system, we combined local EHR data with the NSQIP gold standard outcomes and developed machine learned models to retrospectively detect Surgical Site Infections (SSI), a particular family of adverse events that NSQIP extracts. The built models have high specificity (from 0.788 to 0.988) as well as very high negative predictive values (>0.98), reliably eliminating the vast majority of patients without SSI, thereby significantly reducing the NSQIP extractors’ burden.","Zhen Hu, Gyorgy J Simon, Elliot G Arsoniadis, Yan Wang, Mary R Kwaan, Genevieve B Melton",10.3233/978-1-61499-564-7-706,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2cf5fbf0f7a0114b4ac96593cbb32873cca20d22,0,0,Automated Detection of Postoperative Surgical Site Infections Using Supervised Methods with Electronic Health Record Data,MedInfo,,"['Computer Science', 'Medicine']",Computer Sciences

"Background.  Although many risk factors are well known, Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) continues to be a significant problem throughout the world. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a data-driven, hospital-specific risk stratification procedure for estimating the probability that an inpatient will test positive for C difficile.               Methods.  We consider electronic medical record (EMR) data from patients admitted for ≥24 hours to a large urban hospital in the U.S. between April 2011 and April 2013. Predictive models were constructed using L2-regularized logistic regression and data from the first year. The number of observational variables considered varied from a small set of well known risk factors readily available to a physician to over 10 000 variables automatically extracted from the EMR. Each model was evaluated on holdout admission data from the following year. A total of 34 846 admissions with 372 cases of CDI was used to train the model.               Results.  Applied to the separate validation set of 34 722 admissions with 355 cases of CDI, the model that made use of the additional EMR data yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI], .79–.83), and it significantly outperformed the model that considered only the small set of known clinical risk factors, AUROC of 0.71 (95% CI, .69–.75).               Conclusions.  Automated risk stratification of patients based on the contents of their EMRs can be used to accurately ide.jpegy a high-risk population of patients. The proposed method holds promise for enabling the selective allocation of interventions aimed at reducing the rate of CDI.","Jenna Wiens, Wayne N. Campbell, Ella S. Franklin, John V.

To date, research has focused on developing risk prediction models for CDI that work well across institutions. However, this one-size-fits-all approach ignores important hospital-specific factors. We focus on a generalizable method for building facility-specific models. We demonstrate the applicability of the approach using electronic health records (EHR) from the University of Michigan Hospitals (UM) and the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH).<jats:sec id=""S0899823X18000168_abs2"" sec-type=""methods"">METHODSWe utilized EHR data from 191,014 adult admissions to UM and 65,718 adult admissions to MGH. We extracted patient demographics, admission details, patient history, and daily hospitalization details, resulting in 4,836 features from patients at UM and 1,837 from patients at MGH. We used L2 regularized logistic regression to learn the models, and we measured the discriminative performance of the models on held-out data from each hospital.<jats:sec id=""S0899823X18000168_abs3"" sec-type=""results"">RESULTSUsing the UM and MGH test data, the models achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values of 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80–0.84) and 0.75 ( 95% CI, 0.73–0.78), respectively.

In contrast to traditional approaches that focus on developing models that apply across hospitals, our generalizable approach yields risk-stratification models tailored to an institution. These hospital-specific models allow for earlier and more accurate identification of high-risk patients and better targeting of infection prevention strategies.Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol2018;39:425–433","Jeeheh Oh, Maggie Makar, Christopher Fusco, Robert McCaffrey, Krishna Rao, Erin E Ryan, Laraine Washer, Lauren R West, Vincent B Young, John Guttag, David C Hooper, Erica S Shenoy , Jenna Wiens",10.1017/ice.2018.16,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/ice.2018.16,0,0,"A Generalizable, Data-Driven Approach to Predict Daily Risk of Clostridium difficile Infection at Two Large Academic Health Centers",['Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology'],"(['Infectious Diseases', 'Microbiology (medical)', 'Epidemiology'],)",,Microbiology

However, only 2 of the predictor variables, mean arterial pressure and high temperature, were independently associated with sepsis. In addition, the temperature mean for hypothermia was significantly lower in patients without sepsis. The odds ratio for having sepsis was 2.126 for patients with a temperature of 38°C or higher, 3.874 for patients with a mean arterial blood pressure of less than 70 mm Hg, and 4.63 times greater for patients who had both of these conditions.• Conclusions The results support the use of some of the guidelines of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign.

"Early pathogen exposure detection allows better patient care and faster implementation of public health measures (patient isolation, contact tracing). Existing exposure detection most frequently relies on overt clinical symptoms, namely fever, during the infectious prodromal period. We have developed a robust machine learning based method to better detect asymptomatic states during the incubation period using subtle, sub-clinical physiological markers. Starting with high-resolution physiological waveform data from non-human primate studies of viral (Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, and Nipah viruses) and bacterial (Y. pestis) exposure, we processed the data to reduce short-term variability and normalize diurnal variations, then provided these to a supervised random forest classification algorithm and post-classifier declaration logic step to reduce false alarms. In most subjects detection is achieved well before the onset of fever; subject cross-validation across exposure studies (varying viruses, exposure routes, animal species, and target dose) lead to 51h mean early detection (at 0.93 area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve [AUCROC]). Evaluating the algorithm against entirely independent datasets for Lassa, Nipah, andY. pestisexposures un-used in algorithm training and development yields a mean 51h early warning time (at AUCROC=0.95).

"Objective. Achieving accurate prediction of sepsis detection moment based on bedside monitor data in the intensive care unit (ICU). A good clinical outcome is more probable when onset is suspected and treated on time, thus early insight of sepsis onset may save lives and reduce costs. Methodology. We present a novel approach for feature extraction, which focuses on the hypothesis that unstable patients are more prone to develop sepsis during ICU stay. These features are used in machine learning algorithms to provide a prediction of a patient’s likelihood to develop sepsis during ICU stay, hours before it is diagnosed. Results. Five machine learning algorithms were implemented using R software packages. The algorithms were trained and tested with a set of 4 features which represent the variability in vital signs. These algorithms aimed to calculate a patient’s probability to become septic within the next 4 hours, based on recordings from the last 8 hours. The best area under the curve (AUC) was achieved with Support Vector Machine (SVM) with radial basis function, which was 88.38%. Conclusions. The high level of predictive accuracy along with the simplicity and availability of input variables present great potential if applied in ICUs. Variability of a patient’s vital signs proves to be a good indicator of one’s chance to become septic during ICU stay.","Eli Bloch, Tammy Rotem, Jonathan Cohen, Pierre Singer, Yehudit Aperstein",10.1155/2019/5930379,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/5930379,0,0,Machine Learning Models for Analysis of Vital Signs Dynamics: A Case for Sepsis Onset Prediction,['Journal of Healthcare Engineering'],"(['Health Informatics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Surgery', 'Biotechnology'],)",,Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering

"Background: Seasonal influenza virus outbreaks cause annual epidemics, mostly during winter in temperate zone countries, especially resulting in increased morbidity and higher mortality in children. In order to conduct rapid screening for influenza in pediatric outpatient units, we developed a pediatric infection screening system with a radar respiration monitor. Methods: The system conducts influenza screening within 10 seconds based on vital signs (i.e., respiration rate monitored using a 24 GHz microwave radar; facial temperature, using a thermopile array; and heart rate, using a pulse photosensor). A support vector machine (SVM) classification method was used to discriminate influenza children from healthy children based on vital signs. To assess the classification performance of the screening system that uses the SVM, we conducted influenza screening for 70 children (i.e., 27 seasonal influenza patients (11 ± 2 years) at a pediatric clinic and 43 healthy control subjects (9 ± 4 years) at a pediatric dental clinic) in the winter of 2013-2014. Results: The screening system using the SVM identified 26 subjects with influenza (22 of the 27 influenza patients and 4 of the 43 healthy subjects). The system discriminated 44 subjects as healthy (5 of the 27 influenza patients and 39 of the 43 healthy subjects), with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 81.5%, 90.7%, 84.6%, and 88.6%, respectively. Conclusion: The SVM-based screening system achieved classification results for the outpatient children based on vital signs with comparatively high NPV within 10 seconds. At pediatric clinics and hospitals, our system seems potentially useful in the first screening step for infections in the future.","Guanghao Sun, Yu Yao, Ritsu Yoshinaka, Mayumi Ikegami, Seokjin Kim, Michael Schiek, Takemi Matsui",10.4172/2332-0877.1000163,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7afb668110cc39f23aa7ad998456a2ec9a52bb46,0,0,A Pediatric Infection Screening System with a Radar Respiration Monitor for Rapid Detection of Seasonal Influenza among Outpatient Children,,,['Medicine'],"History of Science, Technology, and Medicine"

"Tabular data is an abundant source of information on the Web, but remains mostly isolated from the latter's interconnections since tables lack links and computer-accessible descriptions of their structure. In other words, the schemas of these tables -- attribute names, values, data types, etc. -- are not explicitly stored as table metadata. Consequently, the structure that these tables contain is not accessible to the crawlers that power search engines and thus not accessible to user search queries. We address this lack of structure with a new method for leveraging the principles of table construction in order to extract table schemas. Discovering the schema by which a table is constructed is achieved by harnessing the similarities and differences of nearby table rows through the use of a novel set of features and a feature processing scheme. The schemas of these data tables are determined using a classification technique based on conditional random fields in combination with a novel feature encoding method called logarithmic binning, which is specifically designed for the data table extraction task. Our method provides considerable improvement over the well-known WebTables schema extraction method. In contrast with previous work that focuses on extracting individual relations, our method excels at correctly interpreting full tables, thereby being capable of handling general tables such as those found in spreadsheets, instead of being restricted to HTML tables as is the case with the WebTables method.

"The avian embryo resorbs most of the calcium for bone formation from the calcite eggshell but the exact mechanisms of the resorption are unknown. The present study tested whether this process results in variable fractionation of the oxygen and carbon isotopes in shell calcium carbonate, which could provide a detailed insight into the temporal and spatial use of the eggshell by the developing embryo. Despite the uncertainty regarding changes in stable isotope composition of the eggshell across developmental stages or regions of the shell, eggshells are a popular resource for the analysis of historic and extant trophic relationships. To clarify how the stable isotope composition varies with embryonic development, the δ13C and δ18O content of the carbonate fraction in shells of black-headed gull (Larus ridibundus) eggs were sampled at four different stages of embryonic development and at five eggshell regions. No consistent relationship between the stable isotope composition of the eggshell and embryonic development, shell region or maculation was observed, although shell thickness decreased with development in all shell regions. By contrast, individual eggs differed significantly in isotope composition. These results establish that eggshells can be used to investigate a species’ carbon and oxygen sources, regardless of the egg’s developmental stage.","['P Cassey', 'I Boomer', 'S Portugal', 'G Maurer']",10.1071/rd10138,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/rd10138,0,2011,Avian embryonic development does not change the stable isotope composition of the calcite eggshell,"['Reproduction, Fertility and Development']","(['Developmental Biology', 'Endocrinology', 'Genetics', 'Molecular Biology', 'Animal Science and Zoology', 'Reproductive Medicine', 'Biotechnology'],)",,Zoology

The egg quality characteristics (NARUSHIN and ROMANOV, 2002; KHURSHID et al., 2004) and embryonic mortality (SCOTT and MACKENZIE, 1993; MROZ et al., 2007) have been well documented for domestic fowl. Egg fertility and embryonic mortality were found affecting hatchability (FAIRCHILD et al., 2002). Egg weight, shell weight, shell thickness and fertility, which are physical characteristics of eggs, also play an important role in the processes of embryo development and hatching success in poultry (NARUSHIN and ROMANOV, 2002; and KHURSHID et al., 2004). However, there is little information in literature regarding egg characteristic parameters and embryo mortality for partridge (ÖZBEY and ESEN, 2007; KIRIKÇI et al., 2007). Many possible (genetic and environmental) factors and complex interactions between them can affect egg characteristics and embryo mortality in partridge. Traditional statistical methods can be cumbersome to analyze this kind of data sets. Classification tree method (CTM) is a potentially powerful tool to predict membership of cases in the classes of a categorical dependent variable from their measurements on one or more predictor variables. CTM will be a good choice, especially when data set is large, relations between variables are non-linear and when independent variables are mixed (both continuous and categorical). CTM is also structurally very simple and easy to visualize. CTM is a binary decision tree. The tree is constructed by splitting the whole data into nodes or sub-groups based on yes/no answers about the values of the predictors. Each split is based on a single predictor variable. On the other hand, some of the predictors may be used more than one times while others may not be used at all. The rule generated at each step maximizes the class purity within each of the two resulting subsets. Each subset is split further based on entirely different relationships.

"Background            Evaluating the features and performance of health information systems can serve to strengthen the systems themselves as well as to guide other organizations in the process of designing and implementing surveillance tools. We adapted an evaluation framework in order to assess electronic immunization data collection systems, and applied it in two Ontario public health units.                                Methods            The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems are broad in nature and serve as an organizational tool to guide the development of comprehensive evaluation materials. Based on these Guidelines, and informed by other evaluation resources and input from stakeholders in the public health community, we applied an evaluation framework to two examples of immunization data collection and examined several system attributes: simplicity, flexibility, data quality, timeliness, and acceptability. Data collection approaches included key informant interviews, logic and completeness assessments, client surveys, and on-site observations.                                Results            Both evaluated systems allow high-quality immunization data to be collected, analyzed, and applied in a rapid fashion. However, neither system is currently able to link to other providers’ immunization data or provincial data sources, limiting the comprehensiveness of coverage assessments. We recommended that both organizations explore possibilities for external data linkage and collaborate with other jurisdictions to promote a provincial immunization repository or data sharing platform.                                Conclusions            Electronic systems such as the ones described in this paper allow immunization data to be collected, analyzed, and applied in a rapid fashion, and represent the infostructure required to establish a population-based immunization registry, critical for comprehensively assessing vaccine coverage.","['Shelley L Deeks', 'Susan Quach', 'Jennifer A Pereira', 'Sherman D Quan', 'Michael Finkelstein', 'Jeffrey C Kwong', 'Christine L Heidebrecht']",10.1186/1472-6947-14-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6947-14-5,1,2014,Electronic immunization data collection systems: application of an evaluation framework,['BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making'],"(['Health Informatics', 'Health Policy', 'Computer Science Applications'],)",,Science

"Consider a data holder, such as a hospital or a bank, that has a privately held collection of person-specific, field structured data. Suppose the data holder wants to share a version of the data with researchers. How can a data holder release a version of its private data with scientific guarantees that the individuals who are the subjects of the data cannot be re-identified while the data remain practically useful? The solution provided in this paper includes a formal protection model named k-anonymity and a set of accompanying policies for deployment. A release provides k-anonymity protection if the information for each person contained in the release cannot be distinguished from at least k-1 individuals whose information also appears in the release. This paper also examines re-identification attacks that can be realized on releases that adhere to k-anonymity unless accompanying policies are respected.

"A long run multioutput cost function for the infrastructure services of Spanish ports is estimated using 286 observations on 26 ports during 11 years. Cargo specific marginal costs and the degree of economies of scale and scope are calculated up to a port level. Results show that liquid bulk and non-containerised general cargo present the lowest and largest marginal cost, respectively. Increasing returns to scale are present in general and for each and every port. A scope analysis indicates that port specialisation is not appropriate from the viewpoint of infrastructure.","['L ', 'C Basso', 'E Cortes', 'S Martinez-Budría', 'Jara Díaz']",10.1023/A:1016386131712,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/347584b2c7428cdc9eb8b1cd24040cd08ae2b318,0,2002,A multioutput cost function for the services of spanish ports’ infrastructure,,,['Engineering'],Science

"The loss of fluid and electrolytes from a high-output ileostomy (&gt;1200 ml/day) can quickly result in dehydration and if not properly managed may cause acute renal failure. The management of a high-output ileostomy is based upon three principles: correction of electrolyte disturbance and fluid balance, pharmacological reduction of ileostomy output, and treatment of any underlying identifiable cause. There is an increasing body of evidence to suggest that Clostridium difficile may behave pathologically in the small intestine producing a spectrum of enteritis that mirrors the well-recognised colonic disease manifestation. Clinically this can range from high-output ileostomy to fulminant enteritis. This report describes two cases of high-output ileostomy associated with enteric C difficile infection and proposes that the management algorithm of a high-output ileostomy should include exclusion of small bowel C difficile.","['A S Miller', 'D Hemingway', 'R N Williams']",10.1136/jcp.2008.062901,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jcp.2008.062901,0,2009,"Enteral Clostrid- ium difficile, an emerging cause for high-output ileostomy",['Journal of Clinical Pathology'],"(['General Medicine', 'Pathology and Forensic Medicine'],)",,Pathology

"The East African Community’s (EAC) economic integration has gained momentum recently, with the EAC countries aiming to adopt a single currency in 2015. This article evaluates empirically the readiness of the EAC countries for monetary union. First, structural similarity in terms of similarity of production and exports of the EAC countries is measured. Second, the symmetry of shocks is examined with structural vector auto-regression analysis (SVAR). The lack of macroeconomic convergence gives evidence against a hurried transition to a monetary union. Given the divergent macroeconomic outcomes, structural reforms, including closing infrastructure gaps and harmonizing macroeconomic policies that would raise synchronization of business cycles, need to be in place before moving to monetary union.","['Zuzana Brixiova', 'Albert Mafusire']",10.1515/gej-2013-0015,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/gej-2013-0015,6,2013,Macroeconomic Shock Synchronization in the East African Community,['Global Economy Journal'],"(['General Economics, Econometrics and Finance'],)",,Economics

"<jats:title content-type=""-heading"">Purpose                – A spectre is hunting embryonic African monetary zones: the European Monetary Union crisis. The purpose of this paper is to assess real, monetary and fiscal policy convergence within the proposed WAM and EAM zones. The introduction of common currencies in West and East Africa is facing stiff challenges in the timing of monetary convergence, the imperative of central bankers to apply common modeling and forecasting methods of monetary policy transmission, as well as the requirements of common structural and institutional characteristics among candidate states.                                        <jats:title content-type=""-heading"">Design/methodology/approach                – In the analysis: monetary policy targets inflation and financial dynamics of depth, efficiency, activity and size; real sector policy targets economic performance in terms of GDP growth at macro and micro levels; while, fiscal policy targets debt-to-GDP and deficit-to-GDP ratios. A dynamic panel GMM estimation with data from different non-overlapping intervals is employed. The implied rate of convergence and the time required to achieve full (100 percent) convergence are then computed from the estimations.                                        <jats:title content-type=""-heading"">Findings                – Findings suggest overwhelming lack of convergence: initial conditions for financial development are different across countries; fundamental characteristics as common monetary policy initiatives and IMF-backed financial reform programs are implemented differently across countries; there is remarkable evidence of cross-country variations in structural characteristics of macroeconomic performance; institutional cross-country differences could also be responsible for the deficiency in convergence within the potential monetary zones; absence of fiscal policy convergence and no potential for eliminating idiosyncratic fiscal shocks due to business cycle incoherence.                                        <jats:title content-type=""-heading"">Practical implications                – As a policy implication, heterogeneous structural and institutional characteristics across countries are giving rise to different levels and patterns of financial intermediary development. Thus, member states should work towards harmonizing cross-country differences in structural and institutional characteristics that hamper the effectiveness of convergence in monetary, real and fiscal policies. This could be done by stringently monitoring the implementation of existing common initiatives and/or the adoption of new reforms programs.                                        <jats:title content-type=""-heading"">Originality/value                – It is one of the few attempts to investigate the issue of convergence within the proposed WAM and EAM unions.",S A Asongu,10.1108/ajems-02-2012-0010,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/ajems-02-2012-0010,4,2014,"Are proposed African monetary unions optimal currency areas?

"To discuss the implications of CSF abnormalities for the course of acute monosymptomatic optic neuritis (AMON), various CSF markers were analysed in patients being randomly selected from a population-based cohort. Paired serum and CSF were obtained within a few weeks from onset of AMON. CSF-restricted oligoclonal IgG bands, free kappa and free lambda chain bands were observed in 17, 15, and nine of 27 examined patients, respectively. Sixteen patients showed a polyspecific intrathecal synthesis of oligoclonal IgG antibodies against one or more viruses. At 1 year follow-up five patients had developed clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS); all had CSF oligoclonal IgG bands and virus-specific oligoclonal IgG antibodies at onset. Due to the relative small number studied at the short-term follow-up, no firm conclusion of the prognostic value of these analyses could be reached. CSF Myelin Basic Protein-like material was increased in only two of 29 patients with AMON, but may have potential value in reflecting disease activity, as the highest values were obtained among patients with CSF sampled soon after the worst visual acuity was reached, and among patients with severe visual impairment. In most previous studies of patients with AMON qualitative and quantitative analyses of CSF IgG had a predictive value for development of CDMS, but the results are conflicting.",J L Frederiksen,10.1177/135245859800400308,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/135245859800400308,6,1998,Can CSF predict the course of optic neuritis?,['Multiple Sclerosis Journal'],"(['Clinical Neurology', 'Neurology'],)",,Science

During a mean follow-up time of 3.8 years, the presence of MS-like brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions and oligoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G bands in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were strong prognostic markers of C DMS, with relative hazard ratios of 4.68 {95% confidence interval (CI) 2.21 -9.91} and 5.39 (95% C I 1.56 -18.61), respectively. Age and season of clinical onset were also significant predictors, with relative hazard ratios of 1.76 (95% C I 1.02 -3.04) and 2.21 (95% C I 1.13 -3.98), respectively. Based on the above two strong predicto rs, individual probability of C DMS development after MO N was calculated in a three-quarter sample drawn from a cohort, with completion of follow-up at three years. The highest probability, 0.66 (95% C I 0.48 -0.80), was obtained for individuals presenting with three or more brain MRI lesions and oligoclonal bands in the C SF, and the lowest, 0.09 (95% C I 0.02 -0.32), for those not presenting with these traits. Medium values, 0.29 (95% C I 0.13 -0.53) and 0.32 (95% C I 0.07 -0.73), were obtained for individuals discordant for the presence of brain MRI lesions and oligoclonal bands in the C SF. These predictions were validated in an external one-quarter sample.","['M Söderström', 'Y H Huang', 'J De Pedro-Cuesta', 'Y P Jin']",10.1191/1352458503ms895oa,http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/1352458503ms895oa,4,2003,Predicting multiple sclerosis at optic neuritis onset,['Multiple Sclerosis Journal'],"(['Clinical Neurology', 'Neurology'],)",,Science

"Reproductive isolation between steelhead and resident rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was examined in the Deschutes River, Oregon, through surveys of spawning timing and location. Otolith microchemistry was used to determine the occurrence of steelhead and resident rainbow trout progeny in the adult populations of steelhead and resident rainbow trout in the Deschutes River and in the Babine River, British Columbia. In the 3 years studied, steelhead spawning occurred from mid March through May and resident rainbow trout spawning occurred from mid March through August. The timing of 50% spawning was 9-10 weeks earlier for steelhead than for resident rainbow trout. Spawning sites selected by steelhead were in deeper water and had larger substrate than those selected by resident rainbow trout. Maternal origin was identified by comparing Sr/Ca ratios in the primordia and freshwater growth regions of the otolith with a wavelength-dispersive electron microprobe. In the Deschutes River, only steelhead of steelhead maternal origin and resident rainbow trout of resident rainbow trout origin were observed. In the Babine River, steelhead of resident rainbow trout origin and resident rainbow trout of steelhead maternal origin were also observed. Based on these findings, we suggest that steelhead and resident rainbow trout in the Deschutes River may constitute reproductively isolated populations.","['Gordon H Reeves', 'Christian E Zimmerman']",10.1139/f00-192,http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f00-192,10,2000,Population structure of sympatric anadromous and nonanadromous Oncorhynchus mykiss: evidence from spawning surveys and otolith microchemistry,['Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences'],"(['Aquatic Science', 'Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics'],)",,Environmental Microbiology and Microbial Ecology
"Strontium isotope and Sr/Ca ratios measured in situ by ion microprobe along radial transects of otoliths of juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) vary between watersheds with contrasting geology. Otoliths from ocean-type chinook from Skagit River estuary, Washington, had prehatch regions with 87Sr/86Sr ratios of ~0.709, suggesting a maternally inherited marine signature, extensive fresh water growth zones with 87Sr/86Sr ratios similar to those of the Skagit River at ~0.705, and marine-like 87Sr/86Sr ratios near their edges. Otoliths from stream-type chinook from central Idaho had prehatch 87Sr/86Sr ratios ≥0.711, indicating that a maternal marine Sr isotopic signature is not preserved after the ~1000- to 1400-km migration from the Pacific Ocean. 87Sr/86Sr ratios in the outer portions of otoliths from these Idaho juveniles were similar to those of their respective streams (~0.7080.722). For Skagit juveniles, fresh water growth was marked by small decreases in otolith Sr/Ca, with increases in Sr/Ca corresponding to increases in 87Sr/86Sr with migration into salt water. Otoliths of Idaho fish had Sr/Ca radial variation patterns that record seasonal fluctuation in ambient water Sr/Ca ratios. The ion microprobe's ability to measure both 87Sr/86Sr and Sr/Ca ratios of otoliths at high spatial resolution in situ provides a new tool for studies of fish rearing and migration.","['Joseph L Wooden', 'John A Fitzpatrick', 'Reginald Reisenbichler', 'Kimberly A Larsen', 'Peter K Weber', 'Charles R Bacon']",10.1139/f04-167,http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f04-167,12,2004,Migration and rearing histories of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) determined by ion microprobe Sr isotope and Sr/Ca transects of otoliths,['Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences'],"(['Aquatic Science', 'Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics'],)",,Environmental Microbiology and Microbial Ecology

Reversible image watermarking can restore the original image without any distortion after the hidden data is extracted. In this paper, we present a novel reversible watermarking scheme using an interpolation technique, which can embed a large amount of covert data into images with imperceptible modification. Different from previous watermarking schemes, we utilize the interpolation-error, the difference between interpolation value and corresponding pixel value, to embed bit ¿1¿ or ¿0¿ by expanding it additively or leaving it unchanged. Due to the slight modification of pixels, high image quality is preserved. Experimental results also demonstrate that the proposed scheme can provide greater payload capacity and higher image fidelity compared with other state-of-the-art schemes.","['Z Xiong', 'X Zeng', 'M Chen', 'Z Chen', 'L Luo']",10.1109/TIFS.2009.2035975,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/651dc47b637b365aef360d79ea3fd9a3a287df54,0,2010,Reversible image watermarking using interpolation technique,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,,['Computer Science'],Computer Sciences

"Background            Genomic deletions and duplications are important in the pathogenesis of diseases, such as cancer and mental retardation, and have recently been shown to occur frequently in unaffected individuals as polymorphisms. Affymetrix GeneChip whole genome sampling analysis (WGSA) combined with 100 K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays is one of several microarray-based approaches that are now being used to detect such structural genomic changes. The popularity of this technology and its associated open source data format have resulted in the development of an increasing number of software packages for the analysis of copy number changes using these SNP arrays.                                Results            We evaluated four publicly available software packages for high throughput copy number analysis using synthetic and empirical 100 K SNP array data sets, the latter obtained from 107 mental retardation (MR) patients and their unaffected parents and siblings. We evaluated the software with regards to overall suitability for high-throughput 100 K SNP array data analysis, as well as effectiveness of normalization, scaling with various reference sets and feature extraction, as well as true and false positive rates of genomic copy number variant (CNV) detection.                                Conclusion            We observed considerable variation among the numbers and types of candidate CNVs detected by different analysis approaches, and found that multiple programs were needed to find all real aberrations in our test set. The frequency of false positive deletions was substantial, but could be greatly reduced by using the SNP genotype information to confirm loss of heterozygosity.","['Marco A Marra', 'J M Friedman', 'Patrice Eydoux', 'Sylvie Langlois', 'Giulia Kennedy', 'Anne Go', 'Nicole Fernandes', 'Mabel Brown-John', 'Patricia Birch', 'Manqiu Cao', 'Adrian Ally', 'Jennifer Asano', 'Susanna Y Chan', 'Hong Qian', 'Stephane Flibotte', 'Tarun Nayar', 'H Irene Li', 'Allen D Delaney', 'Ágnes Baross']",10.1186/1471-2105-8-368,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-8-368,0,2007,Assessment of algorithms for high throughput detection of genomic copy number variation in oligonucleotide microarray data,['BMC Bioinformatics'],"(['Applied Mathematics', 'Computer Science Applications', 'Molecular Biology', 'Biochemistry', 'Structural Biology'],)",,Science

"LEGO© building materials have been adapted as a therapeutic modality for increasing motivation to participate in social skills intervention, and providing a medium through which children with social and communication handicaps can effectively interact. A 3 year retrospective study of long-term outcome for autistic spectrum children participating in LEGO© therapy ( N = 60) compared Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale socialization domain (VABS–SD) and Gilliam Autism Rating Scale social interaction subscale (GARS–SI) scores preand post-treatment with a matched comparison sample ( N = 57) who received comparable non-LEGO© therapy. Although both groups made significant gains on the two outcome measures, LEGO© participants improved significantly more than the comparison subjects. Diagnosis and pre-treatment full-scale IQ scores did not predict outcome scores; however, Vineland adaptive behavior composite, Vineland communication domain, and verbal IQ all predicted outcome on the VABS–SD, especially for the LEGO© therapy group. Results are discussed in terms of implications for methods of social skills intervention for autistic spectrum disorders.","['M Sherman', 'Db &amp; Legoff']",10.1177/1362361306064403,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1362361306064403,0,2006,Long-term outcome of social skills intervention based on interactive LEGO play,['Autism'],"(['Developmental and Educational Psychology'],)",,Science
"This study extends findings on the effects of intensive applied behavior analytic treatment for children with autism who began treatment at a mean age of 5.5 years. The behavioral treatment group ( n = 13, 8 boys) was compared to an eclectic treatment group ( n = 12, 11 boys). Assignment to groups was made independently based on the availability of qualified supervisors. Both behavioral and eclectic treatment took place in public kindergartens and elementary schools for typically developing children. At a mean age of 8 years, 2 months, the behavioral treatment group showed larger increases in IQ and adaptive functioning than did the eclectic group. The behavioral treatment group also displayed fewer aberrant behaviors and social problems at follow-up. Results suggest that behavioral treatment was effective for children with autism in the study.","['Sigmund Eldevik', 'Erik Jahr', 'Tristram Smith', 'Svein Eikeseth']",10.1177/0145445506291396,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0145445506291396,5,2007,Outcome for Children with Autism who Began Intensive Behavioral Treatment Between Ages 4 and 7,['Behavior Modification'],"(['Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology'],)",,Arts and Humanities

"Although cytogenetic abnormalities are important prognostic factors in myeloid malignancies, they are not included in current prognostic scores for primary myelofibrosis (PMF). To determine their relevance in PMF, we retrospectively examined the impact of cytogenetic abnormalities and karyotypic evolution on the outcome of 256 patients. Baseline cytogenetic status impacted significantly on survival: patients with favorable abnormalities (sole deletions in 13q or 20q, or trisomy 9 ± one other abnormality) had survivals similar to those with normal diploid karyotypes (median, 63 and 46 months, respectively), whereas patients with unfavorable abnormalities (rearrangement of chromosome 5 or 7, or ≥ 3 abnormalities) had a poor median survival of 15 months. Patients with abnormalities of chromosome 17 had a median survival of only 5 months. A model containing karyotypic abnormalities, hemoglobin, platelet count, and performance status effectively risk-stratified patients at initial evaluation. Among 73 patients assessable for clonal evolution during stable chronic phase, those who developed unfavorable or chromosome 17 abnormalities had median survivals of 18 and 9 months, respectively, suggesting the potential role of cytogenetics as a risk factor applicable at any time in the disease course. Dynamic prognostic significance of cytogenetic abnormalities in PMF should be further prospectively evaluated.","['S Verstovsek', 'H Kantarjian', 'S Pierce', 'D A Thomas', 'M J Keating', 'A Lynn', 'J Cortes', 'K I Lin', 'L V Abruzzo', 'C S Tam']",10.1182/blood-2008-09-178541,http://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood-2008-09-178541,0,2009,The role of cytogenetic abnormalities as a prognostic marker in primary myelofibrosis: applicability at the time of diagnosis and later during disease course,['Blood'],"(['Cell Biology', 'Hematology', 'Immunology', 'Biochemistry'],)",,Immunology and Infectious Disease

"Treatment with alkylating agents or radiophosphorous (32P) has been shown to carry a certain leukemogenic risk in myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), including essential thrombocytemia (ET). The leukemogenic risk associated to treatment with hydroxyurea in ET, on the other hand, is generally considered to be relatively low. Between 1970 and 1991, we diagnosed ET in 357 patients, who were monitored until 1996. One or several therapeutic agents had been admistered to 326 patients, including hydroxyurea (HU) in 251 (as only treatment in 201), pipobroman in 43, busulfan in 41, and32P in 40. With a median follow-up duration of 98 months, 17 patients (4.5%) had progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML; six cases) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; 11 cases). Fourteen of these patients had received HU, as sole treatment in seven cases, and preceded or followed by other treatment in seven cases, mainly pipobroman (five cases). The remaining three leukemic progressions occurred in patients treated with 32P (two cases) and busulfan (one case). The incidence of AML and MDS after treatment, using 32P alone and 32P with other agents, busulfan alone and with other agents, HU alone and with others agents, and pipobroman alone and with other agents was 7% and 9%, 3% and 17%, 3.5% and 14%, and 0% and 16%, respectively. Thirteen of 17 patients who progressed to AML or MDS had successful cytogenetic analysis. Seven of them had rearrangements of chromosome 17 (unbalanced translocation, partial or complete deletion, isochromosome 17q) that resulted in 17p deletion. They also had a typical form of dysgranulopoiesis combining pseudo Pelger Hüet hypolobulation and vacuoles in neutrophils, and p53 mutation, as previously described in AML and MDS with 17p deletion. Those seven patients had all received HU, as the only therapeutic agent in three, and followed by pipobroman in three. The three patients who had received no HU and progressed to AML or MDS had no 17p deletion. A review of the literature found cytogenetic analysis in 35 cases of AML and MDS occurring after ET, 11 of whom had been treated with HU alone. Five of 35 patients had rearrangements that resulted in 17p deletion. Four of them had been treated with HU alone. These results show that treatment with HU alone is associated with a leukemic risk of approximately 3.5%. A high proportion of AML and MDS occurring in ET treated with HU (alone or possibly followed by pipobroman) have morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular characteristics of the 17p− syndrome. These findings suggest that widespread and prolonged use of HU in ET may have to be reconsidered in some situations, such as asymptomatic ET.","['P Fenaux', 'F Bauters', 'D Bordessoule', 'E Wattel', 'M T Caulier', 'J L Demory', 'J L Lai', 'C Preudhomme', 'Y Sterkers']",10.1182/blood.v91.2.616.616_616_622,http://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood.v91.2.616.616_616_622,0,1998,Acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes following essential thrombocythemia treated with hydroxyurea: high proportion of cases with 17p deletion,['Blood'],"(['Cell Biology', 'Hematology', 'Immunology', 'Biochemistry'],)",,Immunology and Infectious Disease

"We studied the survival of 195 patients with agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (AMM) diagnosed between 1962 and 1992 in an attempt to stratify patients into risk groups. Median survival was 42 months. Adverse prognostic factors for survival were age &gt; 60 years, hepatomegaly, weight loss, low hemoglobin level (Hb), low or very high leukocyte count (WBC), high percentage of circulating blasts, male sex, and low platelet count. A new scoring system based on two adverse prognostic factors, namely Hb &lt; 10 g/dL and WBC &lt; 4 or &gt; 30 x 10(3)/L, was able to separate patients in three groups with low (0 factor), intermediate (1 factor), and high (2 factors) risks, associated with a median survival of 93, 26, and 13 months, respectively. An abnormal karyotype (32 cases of 94 tested patients) was associated with a short survival, especially in the low-risk group (median survival of 50 v 112 months in patients with normal karyotype). The prognostic factors for acute conversion were WBC &gt; 30 x 10(3)/L and abnormal karyotype. Thus, hemoglobin level and leukocyte count provide a simple prognostic model for survival in AMM, and the adverse prognostic value of abnormal karyotype may be related to a higher rate of acute conversion.","['F Bauters', 'I Plantier', 'M Simon', 'J L Lai', 'J L Demory', 'P Morel', 'B Dupriez']",10.1182/blood.v88.3.1013.bloodjournal8831013,http://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood.v88.3.1013.bloodjournal8831013,0,1996,Prognostic factors in agnogenic myeloid metaplasia: a report on 195 cases with a new scoring system,['Blood'],"(['Cell Biology', 'Hematology', 'Immunology', 'Biochemistry'],)",,Immunology and Infectious Disease

"Cytogenetic analysis was performed in 47 newly diagnosed patients with agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (AMM); 32 had a normal karyotype (68%, group I), whereas 15 had clonal abnormalities (32%, group II). The most frequent abnormal findings were a 20q- deletion in six cases (either alone or within complex anomalies), interstitial 13q- deletion in three cases (and monosomy 13 in one case), and acquired trisomy 21 or 21p+ in three cases. Four cases exhibited complex aberrations involving several chromosomes, sometimes with a mosaicism. In two patients with an initial abnormal karyotype, further cytogenetic analysis during the disease course showed the appearance of additional clonal anomalies, and particularly of a probable Philadelphia (Ph1) variant in one case. Treatment was essentially supportive. Survival was significantly shorter in group II (median, 30 months) compared with group I (median, not reached at 6 years; P = .015). In univariate analysis, other parameters significantly associated with a poor prognosis (P less than .05) were higher age, anemia, and increased percentage of circulating blasts.

"This paper reports the results of cytogenetic studies in a consecutive series of 64 patients with polycythemia vera, 57 of whom could be followed prospectively. The median length of the cytogenetic observation time was 93 months (range, 24 to 224 months) after diagnosis. Clonal chromosome abnormalities were observed initially in 11 patients (17%) and later during the course of the disease in another 20 patients. An abnormal karyotype was found in 71% to 80% of the patients who were examined after the development of myeloid metaplasia, myelofibrosis, or leukemia. Patients treated with myelosuppressive agents showed a significantly greater risk of chromosome abnormalities developing than did patients who had been phlebotomized. Acute leukemia developed in eight patients, all of whom had been treated with myelosuppressive agents. A chromosome abnormality preceded the leukemia in only two of the patients. The initial presence of an abnormal karyotype did not predict a greater risk of development of leukemia. No consistent relationship was demonstrated between the occurrence of chromosome abnormalities and the development of myeloid metaplasia and/or myelofibrosis, which was observed in 42% of the patients. The chromosome abnormalities followed a nonrandom pattern, and those most frequently observed were trisomies for 1 q, 8, 9, or 9p and deletion of 20q.

"Cytogenetic abnormalities, evaluated either by karyotype or by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), are considered the most important prognostic factor in multiple myeloma (MM). However, there is no information about the prognostic impact of genomic changes detected by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). We have analyzed the frequency and prognostic impact of genetic changes as detected by CGH and evaluated the relationship between these chromosomal imbalances and IGH translocation, analyzed by FISH, in 74 patients with newly diagnosed MM. Genomic changes were identified in 51 (69%) of the 74 MM patients. The most recurrent abnormalities among the cases with genomic changes were gains on chromosome regions 1q (45%), 5q (24%), 9q (24%), 11q (22%), 15q (22%), 3q (16%), and 7q (14%), while losses mainly involved chromosomes 13 (39%), 16q (18%), 6q (10%), and 8p (10%). Remarkably, the 6 patients with gains on 11q had IGH translocations. Multivariate analysis selected chromosomal losses, 11q gains, age, and type of treatment (conventional chemotherapy vs autologous transplantation) as independent parameters for predicting survival. Genomic losses retained the prognostic value irrespective of treatment approach. According to these results, losses of chromosomal material evaluated by CGH represent a powerful prognostic factor in MM patients.

Chromosomal regions 12p11–13, 13p11– 13, 3q26–28, 6q15–16, and 7q31–35 were rearranged in more than 20% of the analyzable cases. No correlation was found between cytogenetic findings and initial characteristics. When compared with diffuse B-cell lymphomas, defects in regions 2p25 (P less than .01), 12p11–13 (P less than .01), 13p11–13 (P less than .01), 14p11 (P less than .01), 15p11– 13 (P less than .02), and 20q12–13 (P less than .05) were more frequent in HD. When compared with T-cell lymphomas, only defects in regions 12p12–13 (P less than .01) and 13p11–13 (P less than .01) were more frequent in HD. Failure to obtain analyzable metaphases was correlated with stage IV of the disease (P less than .05) and with a poor survival (P less than .01), but cytogenetic results showed no other correlation with clinical outcome. We conclude that molecular studies in HD should be focused on the short arms of chromosomes 12 and 13. Determination of the clinical significance of cytogenetic findings will require a larger number of patients and a longer follow-up period.","['M Monconduit', 'Jp', '́ Dauce', 'B Lenormand', 'M Bizet', 'C Duval', 'T Delastre', 'C Bastard', 'H Tilly']",10.1182/blood.V77.6.1298.1298,http://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood.v77.6.1298.1298,0,1991,Cytogenetic studies in untreated Hodgkin's disease,['Blood'],"(['Cell Biology', 'Hematology', 'Immunology', 'Biochemistry'],)",,Immunology and Infectious Disease
"We describe the chromosomal abnormalities found in 104 previously untreated patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and the correlations of these abnormalities with disease characteristics. The cytogenetic method used was a 24- to 48-hour culture, followed by G- banding. Several significant associations were discovered. A trisomy 3 was correlated with high-grade NHL. In the patients with an immunoblastic NHL, an abnormal chromosome no. 3 or 6 was found significantly more frequently. As previously described, a t(14;18) was significantly correlated with a follicular growth pattern. Abnormalities on chromosome no. 17 were correlated with a diffuse histology and a shorter survival. A shorter survival was also correlated with a +5, +6, +18, all abnormalities on chromosome no. 5, or involvement of breakpoint 14q11–12. In a multivariate analysis, these chromosomal abnormalities appeared to be independent prognostic factors and correlated with survival more strongly than any traditional prognostic variable. Patients with a t(11;14)(q13;q32) had an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Skin infiltration was correlated with abnormalities on 2p. Abnormalities involving breakpoints 6q11–16 were correlated with B symptoms. Patients with abnormalities involving breakpoints 3q21–25 and 13q21–24 had more frequent bulky disease. The correlations of certain clinical findings with specific chromosomal abnormalities might help unveil the pathogenetic mechanisms of NHL and tailor treatment regimens.","['J O Armitage', 'J Anderson', 'D D Weisenburger', 'W G Sanger', 'H C Schouten']",10.1182/blood.v75.9.1841.1841,http://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood.v75.9.1841.1841,0,1990,"Chromosomal abnormalities in untreated patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma: associations with histology, clinical characteristics, and treatment outcome.

"The development of chromosomal abnormalities (CAs) in the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)–negative metaphases during imatinib (IM) therapy in patients with newly diagnosed chronic myecloid leukemia (CML) has been reported only anecdotally. We assessed the frequency and significance of this phenomenon among 258 patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase receiving IM. After a median follow-up of 37 months, 21 (9%) patients developed 23 CAs in Ph-negative cells; excluding −Y, this incidence was 5%. Sixteen (70%) of all CAs were observed in 2 or more metaphases. The median time from start of IM to the appearance of CAs was 18 months. The most common CAs were −Y and + 8 in 9 and 3 patients, respectively. CAs were less frequent in young patients (P = .02) and those treated with high-dose IM (P = .03). In all but 3 patients, CAs were transient and disappeared after a median of 5 months. One patient developed acute myeloid leukemia (associated with − 7). At last follow-up, 3 patients died from transplantation-related complications, myocardial infarction, and progressive disease and 2 lost cytogenetic response. CAs occur in Ph-negative cells in a small percentage of patients with newly diagnosed CML treated with IM. In rare instances, these could reflect the emergence of a new malignant clone.","['J Cortes', 'M B Rios', 'J Shan', 'S Verstovsek', 'G Garcia-Manero', 'S O’brien', 'L V Abruzzo', 'H M Kantarjian', 'E Jabbour']",10.1182/blood-2007-01-070045,http://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood-2007-01-070045,0,2007,Chromosomal abnormalities in Philadelphia chromosome negative metaphases appearing during imatinib mesylate therapy in patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase,['Blood'],"(['Cell Biology', 'Hematology', 'Immunology', 'Biochemistry'],)",,Immunology and Infectious Disease
"We have generated a large, unique database that includes morphologic, clinical, cytogenetic, and follow-up data from 2124 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) at 4 institutions in Austria and 4 in Germany. Cytogenetic analyses were successfully performed in 2072 (97.6%) patients, revealing clonal abnormalities in 1084 (52.3%) patients. Numeric and structural chromosomal abnormalities were documented for each patient and subdivided further according to the number of additional abnormalities. Thus, 684 different cytogenetic categories were identified. The impact of the karyotype on the natural course of the disease was studied in 1286 patients treated with supportive care only. Median survival was 53.4 months for patients with normal karyotypes (n = 612) and 8.7 months for those with complex anomalies (n = 166). A total of 13 rare abnormalities were identified with good (+1/+1q, t(1q), t(7q), del(9q), del(12p), chromosome 15 anomalies, t(17q), monosomy 21, trisomy 21, and −X), intermediate (del(11q), chromosome 19 anomalies), or poor (t(5q)) prognostic impact, respectively. The prognostic relevance of additional abnormalities varied considerably depending on the chromosomes affected. For all World Health Organization (WHO) and French-American-British (FAB) classification system subtypes, the karyotype provided additional prognostic information. Our analyses offer new insights into the prognostic significance of rare chromosomal abnormalities and specific karyotypic combinations in MDS.","['J Schanz', 'U Germing', 'D Haase']",10.1182/blood-2007-03-082404,http://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood-2007-03-082404,0,2007,New insights into the prognostic impact of the karyotype in MDS and correlation with subtypes: evidence from a core dataset of 2124 patients,['Blood'],"(['Cell Biology', 'Hematology', 'Immunology', 'Biochemistry'],)",,Immunology and Infectious Disease
"Cytogenetics is considered one of the most valuable prognostic determinants in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, many studies on which this assertion is based were limited by relatively small sample sizes or varying treatment approach, leading to conflicting data regarding the prognostic implications of specific cytogenetic abnormalities. The Medical Research Council (MRC) AML 10 trial, which included children and adults up to 55 years of age, not only affords the opportunity to determine the independent prognostic significance of pretreatment cytogenetics in the context of large patient groups receiving comparable therapy, but also to address their impact on the outcome of subsequent transplantation procedures performed in first complete remission (CR). On the basis of response to induction treatment, relapse risk, and overall survival, three prognostic groups could be defined by cytogenetic abnormalities detected at presentation in comparison with the outcome of patients with normal karyotype. AML associated with t(8;21), t(15;17) or inv(16) predicted a relatively favorable outcome. Whereas in patients lacking these favorable changes, the presence of a complex karyotype, −5, del(5q), −7, or abnormalities of 3q defined a group with relatively poor prognosis. The remaining group of patients including those with 11q23 abnormalities, +8, +21, +22, del(9q), del(7q) or other miscellaneous structural or numerical defects not encompassed by the favorable or adverse risk groups were found to have an intermediate prognosis. The presence of additional cytogenetic abnormalities did not modify the outcome of patients with favorable cytogenetics. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the three cytogenetically defined prognostic groups retained their predictive value in the context of secondary as well as de novo AML, within the pediatric age group and furthermore were found to be a key determinant of outcome from autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in first CR. This study highlights the importance of diagnostic cytogenetics as an independent prognostic factor in AML, providing the framework for a stratified treatment approach of this disease, which has been adopted in the current MRC AML 12 trial.","['F Oliver', 'H Walker', 'D Grimwade']",10.1182/blood.v92.7.2322,http://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood.v92.7.2322,0,1998,"The importance of diagnostic cytogenetics on outcome in AML: analysis of 1,612 patients entered into the MRC AML 10 trial",['Blood'],"(['Cell Biology', 'Hematology', 'Immunology', 'Biochemistry'],)",,Immunology and Infectious Disease

"Background: Previous cytogenetic studies in polycythemia vera (PV) have included a relatively small number of patients (“n” ranging 10–64). In the current study (n=137), we describe cytogenetic findings at presentation and examine their relationship to clinical and laboratory features, including bone marrow JAK2V617F allele burden.               Methods: The study consisted of a consecutive group of patients with PV who fulfilled the World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria and in whom bone marrow biopsy and cytogenetic studies were performed at diagnosis.               Results I: cytogenetic details At diagnosis: A total of 137 patients (median age, 64 years; 49% females) were studied at diagnosis and had adequate metaphases for interpretation. Cytogenetics were normal in 117 patients (85%) and displayed either a sole -Y abnormality in 5 patients (7% of the male patients), and other chromosomal abnormalities in 15 (11%). The latter included trisomy 8 in five patients, trisomy 9 in three patients, two patients each with del(13q), del(20q), and abnormalities of chromosome 1, and one patient each with del(3)(p13p21), dup(13)(q12q14), and del(11)(q21). At follow-up: Repeat cytogenetic studies while still in the chronic phase of the disease were performed in 19 patients at a median of 60 months (range, 8–198) from diagnosis. Of these, 4 had aquired new cytogenetic clones including 3 with normal cytogenetics at time of initial PV diagnosis. The new abnormalities included del(20q), del(5q), del(1p), chromosome 1 abnormality, and inv(3)(q21q26.2). At time of disease transformation: Leukemic transformation was documented in 3 patients of whom cytogenetic information at the time was available in 2 patients; both patients had normal results at time of initial PV diagnosis and complex cytogenetic abnormalities at time of leukemic transformation. In contrast, among 6 patients with available cytogenetic information at time of fibrotic transformation, the results were unchanged from those obtained at time of diagnosis in 5 patients. ii) Correlation between cytogenetics at diagnosis and JAK2V617F allele burden: Allele-specific, quantitative PCR analysis for JAK2V617F was performed in 71 patients using genomic DNA from archived bone marrow obtained at the time of the initial cytogenetic studies. JAK2V617F mutation was detected in 64 of the 71 (90%) patients; median mutant allele burden was 16% (range 3–80%) without significant difference among the different cytogenetic groups: normal vs. –Y vs. other cytogenetic abnormalities (p=0.72). iii) Clinical correlates and prognostic relevance of cytogenetic findings at diagnosis: Among several parameters studied for significant correlations with cytogenetic findings at diagnosis, an association was evident only for age (p=0.02); all –Y abnormalities (n=5) as well as 13 of the 15 (87%) other cytogenetic abnormalities occurred in patients ≥ 60 years of age. Stated another way, the incidence of abnormal cytogenetics (other than -Y) was 4% for patients younger than age 60 years and 15% otherwise. The presence of abnormal cytogenetics at diagnosis had no significant impact on either overall or leukemia-free survival.               Conclusions: Abnormal cytogenetic findings at diagnosis are infrequent in PV, especially in patients below age 60 years. Furthermore, their clinical relevance is limited and there is not significant correlation with bone marrow JAK2V617F allele burden.","['A Tefferi', 'R P Ketterling', 'C Y Li', 'A Pardanani', 'R A Knudson', 'C M Finke', 'T L Lasho', 'J Strand', 'N Gangat']",10.1182/blood.v110.11.2545.2545,http://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood.v110.11.2545.2545,0,2008,Cyto- genetic studies at diagnosis in polycythemia vera: clinical and JAK2V617F allele burden correlates,['Blood'],"(['Cell Biology', 'Hematology', 'Immunology', 'Biochemistry'],)",,Immunology and Infectious Disease

"Anastomotic leak (AL) is one of the most serious complications after gastrointestinal surgery. All patients aged 16 years or older who underwent a surgery with single intestinal anastomosis at Morristown Medical Center from January 2006 to June 2008 were entered into a prospective database. To compare the rate of AL, patients were divided into the following surgery-related groups: 1) stapled versus hand-sewn, 2) small bowel versus large bowel, 3) right versus left colon, 4) emergent versus elective, 5) laparoscopic versus converted (laparoscopic to open) versus open, 6) inflammatory bowel disease versus non inflammatory bowel disease, and 7) diverticulitis versus nondiverticulitis. We also looked for surgical site infection, estimated intraoperative blood loss, blood transfusion, comorbidities, preoperative chemotherapy, radiation, and anticoagulation treatment. The overall rate of AL was 3.8 per cent. Mortality rate was higher among patients with ALs (13.3%) versus patients with no AL (1.7%). Open surgery had greater risk of AL than laparoscopic operations. Surgical site infection and intraoperative blood transfusions were also associated with significantly higher rates of AL. Operations involving the left colon had greater risk of AL when compared with those of the right colon, sigmoid, and rectum. Prior chemotherapy, anticoagulation, and intraoperative blood loss all increased the AL rates. In conclusion, we identified several significant risk factors for ALs. This knowledge should help us better understand and prevent this serious complication, which has significant morbidity and mortality rates.","['R H ', 'V P Rolandelli', 'R Koshenkov', 'P A Bustami', 'Z Barratt-Stopper', 'J J Luj An']",10.1177/000313481107700929,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/000313481107700929,0,2011,Factors influencing the outcome of intestinal anastomosis,['The American Surgeon'],"(['General Medicine'],)",,Science

"The way in which public sector entities disseminate information publicly is affected by the degree of transparency adopted, and the construction and management of websites are increasingly essential elements of modern public administration. Nonetheless, differences in this process exist among governments worldwide, probably due to different contextual factors. This article examines and discusses the approach of Anglo-Saxon, South American and Continental European central governments to the use of the Web as a means of making financial disclosures. To measure the disclosure of governmental financial information on the Internet, an index has been defined, taking into consideration the data considered to be relevant for a potential user, gathering the data visiting their websites. The results show that the way different countries use the Web for financial disclosure is deeply rooted in and follows from their administrative culture. In conclusion, the Continental European and South American governments should improve their digital reporting.","['Antonio M López Hernández', 'Carmen Caba Pérez', 'Manuel Pedro Rodríguez Bolívar']",10.1177/0020852306064614,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0020852306064614,6,2006,Cultural contexts and governmental digital reporting,['International Review of Administrative Sciences'],"(['Public Administration', 'Sociology and Political Science'],)",,Political Science
"Technology has changed the way public organizations relate to the public. Government's use of the Internet and other associated technologies, known as e-government, could become the instrument that makes regular timely information on public finances more forthcoming. New technologies can improve government responsiveness and empower individual citizens. By making government financial information available, the public could continuously assess a government agency through everyday interaction. The financial accountability of government and its response to public demands for information and services are thus a contribution to government openness. It is therefore relevant to determine whether public organizations are also becoming more aware of the importance of placing financial information on their Web sites to help in decision-making processes. This article focuses on the e-democracy process, specifically the transparency of government information, by analyzing governmental financial disclosures on the Web as a tool for the public to assess its financial accountability.

". Reliable ship detection plays an important role in both military and civil fields. However, it makes the task difficult with high-resolution remote sensing images with complex background and various types of ships with different poses, shapes and scales. Related works mostly used gray and shape features to detect ships, which obtain results with poor robustness and efficiency. To detect ships more automatically and robustly, we propose a novel ship detection method based on the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), called SCNN, fed with specifically designed proposals extracted from the ship model combined with an improved saliency detection method. Firstly we creatively propose two ship models, the “V” ship head model and the “||” ship body one, to localize the ship proposals from the line segments extracted from a test image. Next, for offshore ships with relatively small sizes, which cannot be efficiently picked out by the ship models due to the lack of reliable line segments, we propose an improved saliency detection method to find these proposals. Therefore, these two kinds of ship proposals are fed to the trained CNN for robust and efficient detection. Experimental results on a large amount of representative remote sensing images with different kinds of ships with varied poses, shapes and scales demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our proposed S-CNN-Based ship detector.","['Jiadong Zhang', 'Chen Feng', 'Kao Zhang', 'Jian Yao', 'Ruiqian Zhang']",10.5194/isprs-archives-xli-b7-423-2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xli-b7-423-2016,6,2016,S-CNN-BASED SHIP DETECTION FROM HIGH-RESOLUTION REMOTE SENSING IMAGES,"['The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences']","([],)",,Science

"The spatial resolution is increasingly high as development of optical remote sensing, and more and more optical sensors can achieve the detection ability of sub meter, which lays down the data foundation for automatic recognition of ship targets. However, mature technology is lacked to identify the ship models automatically with remote sensing images. In this study, an automatic recognition method for ship targets is proposed based on the local invariant feature extraction algorithm SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform), which is consist of feature extraction and description, feature matching and target recognition. The model of unknown target is identified based on the target library using the matching difference of targets with the same model and different models. The experiment results show that this automatic recognition flow is effective to identify the ship targets of interest based on the target library, and the total correct recognition rate is 92%. This method provides a new flow for automatic model recognition of ship targets, and has considerable potential for wide applications.","['J Chen', 'B Shi', 'K Sun', 'T Shuai']",10.1109/EORSA.2016.7552786,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a6beeea9ae6f3b258182722e11a23a8e56d5e036,0,2016,A ship target automatic recognition method for sub-meter remote sensing images,2016 4th International Workshop on Earth Observation and Remote Sensing Applications (EORSA),,['Computer Science'],Computer Sciences

". Reliably ship detection in optical satellite images has a wide application in both military and civil fields. However, this problem is very difficult in complex backgrounds, such as waves, clouds, and small islands. Aiming at these issues, this paper explores an automatic and robust model for ship detection in large-scale optical satellite images, which relies on detecting statistical signatures of ship targets, in terms of biologically-inspired visual features. This model first selects salient candidate regions across large-scale images by using a mechanism based on biologically-inspired visual features, combined with visual attention model with local binary pattern (CVLBP). Different from traditional studies, the proposed algorithm is high-speed and helpful to focus on the suspected ship areas avoiding the separation step of land and sea. Largearea images are cut into small image chips and analyzed in two complementary ways: Sparse saliency using visual attention model and detail signatures using LBP features, thus accordant with sparseness of ship distribution on images. Then these features are employed to classify each chip as containing ship targets or not, using a support vector machine (SVM). After getting the suspicious areas, there are still some false alarms such as microwaves and small ribbon clouds, thus simple shape and texture analysis are adopted to distinguish between ships and nonships in suspicious areas. Experimental results show the proposed method is insensitive to waves, clouds, illumination and ship size.","['Song Zhina', 'Sui Haigang']",10.5194/isprs-archives-xli-b3-917-2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xli-b3-917-2016,6,2016,A NOVEL SHIP DETECTION METHOD FOR LARGE-SCALE OPTICAL SATELLITE IMAGES BASED ON VISUAL LBP FEATURE AND VISUAL ATTENTION MODEL,"['The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences']","([],)",,Science

". After a long period of drought, the water level of the Danube River has significantly dropped especially on the Romanian sector, in July-August 2015. Danube reached the lowest water level recorded in the last 12 years, causing the blockage of the ships in the sector located close to Zimnicea Harbour. The rising sand banks in the navigable channel congested the commercial traffic for a few days with more than 100 ships involved. The monitoring of the decreasing water level and the traffic jam was performed based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 free data provided by the European Space Agency and the European Commission within the Copernicus Programme. Specific processing methods (calibration, speckle filtering, geocoding, change detection, image classification, principal component analysis, etc.) were applied in order to generate useful products that the responsible authorities could benefit from. The Sentinel data yielded good results for water mask extraction and ships detection. The analysis continued after the closure of the crisis situation when the water reached the nominal level again. The results indicate that Sentinel data can be successfully used for ship traffic monitoring, building the foundation of future endeavours for a durable monitoring of the Danube River.","['A Badea', 'V G Olteanu', 'V D Poenaru', 'I Dana Negula']",10.5194/isprs-archives-xli-b8-37-2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xli-b8-37-2016,6,2016,SENTINEL-1/2 DATA FOR SHIP TRAFFIC MONITORING ON THE DANUBE RIVER,"['The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences']","([],)",,Science

"We propose a novel framework for large-scale maritime ship group surveillance using spaceborne optical imaging satellite data and Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) satellite data. Considering that the size of a ship is usually less than the distance between different ships for large-scale maritime surveillance, we treat each ship as a mass point and ship groups are modelled as point sets. Motivated by the observation that ship groups performing tactical or strategic operations often have a stable topology and their attributes remain unchanged, we combine both topological features and attributive features within the framework of Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory for coherent ship group analysis. Our method has been tested using different sets of simulated data and recorded data. Experimental results demonstrate our method is robust and efficient for large-scale maritime surveillance.","['C Lu', 'S Zhou', 'K Ji', 'H Zou', 'H Sun']",10.1017/s0373463314000654,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0373463314000654,0,2015,Combined use of optical imaging satellite data and electronic intelligence satellite data for large scale ship group surveillance,['Journal of Navigation'],"(['Ocean Engineering', 'Oceanography'],)",,Science
"In this paper, we introduce a new feature representation based on fusing local texture description of saliency map and enhanced global statistics for ship scene detection in very high-resolution remote sensing images in inland, coastal, and oceanic regions. First, two low computational complexity methods are adopted. Specifically, the Itti attention model is used to extract saliency map, from which local texture histograms are extracted by LBP with uniform pattern. Meanwhile, Gabor filters with multi-scale and multi-orientation are convolved with the input image to extract Gist, means and variances which are used to form the enhanced global statistics. Second, sliding window-based detection is applied to obtain local image patches and extract the fusion of local and global features. SVM with RBF kernel is then used for training and classification. Such detection manner could remove coastal and oceanic regions effectively. Moreover, the ship scene region of interest can be detected accurately. Experiments on 20 very high-resolution remote sensing images collected by Google Earth shows that the fusion feature has advantages than LBP, Saliency map-based LBP and Gist, respectively. Furthermore, desirable results can be obtained in the ship scene detection.","['T Fang', 'H Huo', 'L Wan', 'Y Guo', 'D Shi']",10.1109/PIC.2015.7489860,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7c1448d59429eae8e32d95a1db9a869bcab0e3e0,0,2015,Fusing local texture description of saliency map and enhanced global statistics for ship scene detection,2015 IEEE International Conference on Progress in Informatics and Computing (PIC),,['Computer Science'],Computer Sciences

"With the development of high-resolution imagery, ship detection in optical satellite images has attracted a lot of research interest because of the broad applications in fishery management, vessel salvage, etc. Major challenges for this task include cloud, wave, and wake clutters, and even the variability of ship sizes.

Visual saliency, which focuses on highlighting salient signals from scenes, is applied to extract candidate regions followed by a homogeneous filter presented to confirm suspected ship targets with complete profiles.

The invariant generalized Hough transform is an effective shape extraction technique, but it is not adaptive to shape deformation well. In order to improve its adaptability, we use an iterative training method to learn a robust shape model automatically. The model could capture the shape variability of the target contained in the training data set, and every point in the model is equipped with an individual weight according to its importance, which greatly reduces the false-positive rate. Through the iteration process, the model performance is gradually improved by extending the shape model with these necessary weighted points.

"Reliably ship detection in optical satellite images has a wide application in both military and civil fields. However, the problem is extremely difficult in the complex background, such as waves, clouds, and small islands. Aiming at these issues, this paper explores an automatic and robust algorithm based on biologically-inspired visual features, combined with visual attention model with local binary pattern (CVLBP). Different from traditional studies, the proposed algorithm is simple, general, and not designed for specific types of images. Large-area images are cut into small image chips and analyzed in two complementary ways: Sparse saliency using visual attention model and detail signatures using LBP features, thus accordant with sparseness of ship distribution on images. Then these features are employed to classify each chip as containing ship target or not, using a support vector machine method. Experimental results show the proposed method is insensitive to waves, clouds, and illumination, as well as high precision and low false alarms performance.","['Y Wang', 'H Sui', 'Z Song']",10.1109/IWECA.2014.6845723,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/04e1ba85a13543c100642e5d668fb541c16de3df,0,2014,Automatic ship detection for optical satellite images based on visual attention model and LBP,"2014 IEEE Workshop on Electronics, Computer and Applications",,['Geography'],Science
"Ship detection in high-resolution optical imagery is a challenging task due to the variable appearances of ships and background. This paper aims at further investigating this problem and presents an approach to detect ships in a “coarse-to-fine” manner. First, to increase the separability between ships and background, we concentrate on the pixels in the vicinities of ships. We rearrange the spatially adjacent pixels into a vector, transforming the panchromatic image into a “fake” hyperspectral form. Through this procedure, each produced vector is endowed with some contextual information, which amplifies the separability between ships and background. Afterward, for the “fake” hyperspectral image, a hyperspectral algorithm is applied to extract ship candidates preliminarily and quickly by regarding ships as anomalies. Finally, to validate real ships out of ship candidates, an extra feature is provided with histograms of oriented gradients (HOGs) to generate a hypothesis using AdaBoost algorithm. This extra feature focuses on the gray values rather than the gradients of an image and includes some information generated by very near but not closely adjacent pixels, which can reinforce HOG to some degree. Experimental results on real database indicate that the hyperspectral algorithm is robust, even for the ships with low contrast. In addition, in terms of the shape of ships, the extended HOG feature turns out to be better than HOG itself as well as some other features such as local binary pattern.","['B Li', 'Z Jiang', 'X Yu', 'Z Shi']",10.1109/TGRS.2013.2282355,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6c8a98abd8f5084569e50d7efe4952ad774bf602,0,2014,Ship detection in high-resolution optical imagery based on anomaly detector and local shape feature,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,,['Computer Science'],Computer Sciences

". Vessel monitoring and surveillance is important for maritime safety and security, environment protection and border control. Ship monitoring systems based on Synthetic-aperture Radar (SAR) satellite images are operational. On SAR images the ships made of metal with sharp edges appear as bright dots and edges, therefore they can be well distinguished from the water. Since the radar is independent from the sun light and can acquire images also by cloudy weather and rain, it provides a reliable service. Vessel detection from spaceborne optical images (VDSOI) can extend the SAR based systems by providing more frequent revisit times and overcoming some drawbacks of the SAR images (e.g. lower spatial resolution, difficult human interpretation). Optical satellite images (OSI) can have a higher spatial resolution thus enabling the detection of smaller vessels and enhancing the vessel type classification. The human interpretation of an optical image is also easier than as of SAR image. In this paper I present a rapid automatic vessel detection method which uses pattern recognition methods, originally developed in the computer vision field. In the first step I train a binary classifier from image samples of vessels and background. The classifier uses simple features which can be calculated very fast. For the detection the classifier is slided along the image in various directions and scales. The detector has a cascade structure which rejects most of the background in the early stages which leads to faster execution. The detections are grouped together to avoid multiple detections. Finally the position, size(i.e. length and width) and heading of the vessels is extracted from the contours of the vessel. The presented method is parallelized, thus it runs fast (in minutes for 16000 × 16000 pixels image) on a multicore computer, enabling near real-time applications, e.g. one hour from image acquisition to end user.",G Máttyus,10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-1-w1-233-2013,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-1-w1-233-2013,5,2013,NEAR REAL-TIME AUTOMATIC MARINE VESSEL DETECTION ON OPTICAL SATELLITE IMAGES,"['The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences']","([],)",,Science

"Ship detection is an important stage for the sea- area surveillance and many algorithms have been proposed for dealing with such tasks. Nevertheless, most of them are designed for large-sized ships and are not efficient for the small ones. In this paper, we present a novel method based on cumulative projection curve(CPC) to estimate the number of ships of small size. We firstly compute the Mahalanobis distance between each pixel of the image and the pixel intensities distribution of water, and then project these Mahalanobis distances to their near coastline vertically. The projected one-dimension curve is called cumulative projection curve. By doing this, each ship along the coastline will incur a fluctuating, the ship response, in the CPC. Thus, the number of ships can be estimated through the estimation for the number of ship responses in the CPC. This method simplifies the detection problem by converting a two-dimension problem to an one-dimension problem, and its efficiency is illustrated by the experimental results in the paper.","['Y Wu', 'Y Hu']",10.1109/ICALIP.2008.4590172,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9deff4ba9b28bf55437c5c30c3e32b0fcb84f1e5,0,2008,Number estimation of small-sized ships in remote sensing image based on cumulative projection curve,"2008 International Conference on Audio, Language and Image Processing",,['Computer Science'],Computer Sciences

"Within today's security environment and with increasing worldwide travel and transport of dangerous goods the need of vessel traffic services, ship routing and monitoring of ship movements on sea and along coastlines becomes more time consuming and an important responsibility for coastal authorities. This paper describes the architecture of a ship detection prototype based on an object-oriented methodology to support these monitoring tasks. The system’s architecture comprises a fully-automatic coastline detection tool, a tool for fully or semiautomatic ship detection in off-shore areas and a semi-automatic tool for ship detection within harbour-areas. Its core is based on the client-server environment of the first object-oriented image analysis software on the market named eCognition. The described ship detection system has been developed for panchromatic VHR satellite image data and has proven its capabilities on Ikonos and QuickBird imagery under different weather conditions and for various regions of the world. With the capability of eCognition to combine raster data with imported thematic data it is possible to work with available non-remote sensing based data e.g. detailed harbour GIS information in ESRI shape file format or weather information, which can be attached to the results. Finally the system’s ability of generating customized reports in HTML format and the possibility of exporting results in standard raster or vector format offers new opportunities in the direction of an interoperability of technology where a great number of heterogeneous networks and operators are involved in the surveillance process.

"The aim of the present study was to investigate the chemical composition, antioxidant, angiotensin Iconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antibacterial and antifungal activities of the essential oil of Artemisia herba alba Asso (Aha), a traditional medicinal plant widely growing in Tunisia. The essential oil from the air dried leaves and flowers of Aha were extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC and GC/MS. More than fifty compounds, out of which 48 were identified. The main chemical class of the oil was represented by oxygenated monoterpenes (50.53%). These were represented by 21 derivatives, among which the cis -chrysantenyl acetate (10.60%), the sabinyl acetate (9.13%) and the α-thujone (8.73%) were the principal compounds. Oxygenated sesquiterpenes, particularly arbusculones were identified in the essential oil at relatively high rates. The Aha essential oil was found to have an interesting antioxidant activity as evaluated by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and the β-carotene bleaching methods. The Aha essential oil also exhibited an inhibitory activity towards the ACE. The antimicrobial activities of Aha essential oil was evaluated against six bacterial strains and three fungal strains by the agar diffusion method and by determining the inhibition zone. The inhibition zones were in the range of 8-51 mm. The essential oil exhibited a strong growth inhibitory activity on all the studied fungi. Our findings demonstrated that Aha growing wild in South-Western of Tunisia seems to be a new chemotype and its essential oil might be a natural potential source for food preservation and for further investigation by developing new bioactive substances.

"SUMMARYArtemisia herba-alba Asso has been successfully cultivated in the Tunisian arid zone. However, information regarding the effects of the harvest frequency on its biomass and essential oil yields is very limited. In this study, the effects of three different frequencies of harvesting the upper half of the A. herba-alba plant tuft were compared. The harvest treatments were: harvesting the same individual plants at the flowering stage annually; harvesting the same individual plants at the full vegetative growth stage annually and harvesting the same individual plants every six months. Statistical analyses indicated that all properties studied were affected by the harvest frequency. Essential oil yield, depended both on the dry biomass and its essential oil content, and was significantly higher from plants harvested annually at the flowering stage than the other two treatments. The composition of the β- and α-thujone-rich oils did not vary throughout the experimental period.","['Mohamed Neffati', 'Felix Tomi', 'Joseph Casanova', 'Ahmed Akrout', 'Hedi Mighri']",10.1017/s0014479709990445,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0014479709990445,8,2009,IMPACT OF SEASON AND HARVEST FREQUENCY ON BIOMASS AND ESSENTIAL OIL YIELDS OF ARTEMISIA HERBA-ALBA CULTIVATED IN SOUTHERN TUNISIA,['Experimental Agriculture'],"(['Agronomy and Crop Science'],)",,Agronomy and Crop Sciences

Essential oil from Artemisia herba alba (Art) was hydrodistilled and tested as corrosion inhibitor of steel in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 using weight loss measurements and electrochemical polarization methods. Results gathered show that this natural oil reduced the corrosion rate by the cathodic action. Its inhibition efficiency attains the maximum (74%) at 1 g/L. The inhibition efficiency of Arm oil increases with the rise of temperature. The adsorption isotherm of natural product on the steel has been determined. A. herba alba essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation and its chemical composition oil was investigated by capillary GC and GC/MS.

"In 1994, Bechtel, along with Amoco as the main subcontractor, developed a Baseline Design (and an ASPEN Plus computer process simulation model) for indirect coal liquefaction using advanced Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) technology to produce highquality, liquid transportation fuels. This was done under DOE Contract No. DE-AC22-91PC90027. In 1995, the original study was extended to develop a case in which natural gas, instead of coal, is used as the feedstock. The results, presented at last year’s Contractors’ Conference, show that a natural gas F-T plant is less capital intensive, and as a consequence, attractive F-T economics may be attained with low cost remote gas.

"SummaryArabidopsis thaliana is a small flowering plant of the mustard family. It has a four to five week generation time, can be self- or cross-pollinated and bears as many as 104 seeds per plant. Many visible and biochemical mutations exist and have been mapped by recombination to one of the five chromosomes that comprise the haploid karyotype. With the experiments reported here we demonstrate that Arabidopsis has an extraordinarily small haploid genome size (approximately 7×107 nucleotide pairs) and a low level of cytosine methylation for an angiosperm. In addition, it appears to have little repetitive DNA in its nuclear DNA, in contrast to other higher plants.","['E M Meyerowitz', 'B R Hough-Evans', 'L S Leutwiler']",10.1007/BF00383491,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5e4c0fe86b467ee471f66b6dd0665196198ad8a4,0,1984,The DNA of Arabidopsis thaliana,Molecular and General Genetics MGG,,['Biology'],"Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology"

"The term ""middle-income trap"" has entered common parlance in the development policy community, despite the lack of a precise definition. This paper discusses in more detail the definitional issues associated with the term. It also provides evidence on whether the growth performance of middle-income countries (MICs) has been different from other income categories, including historical transition phases in the inter-country distribution of income. A transition matrix analysis and an exploration of cross-country growth patterns provide little support for the existence of a middle-income trap.","['David Rosenblatt', 'Fernando Gabriel Im']",10.1142/s1793993315500131,http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/s1793993315500131,10,2015,Middle-Income Traps: A Conceptual and Empirical Survey,"['Journal of International Commerce, Economics and Policy']","(['Economics and Econometrics', 'Finance', 'General Business, Management and Accounting'],)",,Econometrics

"This paper proposes a new two-stage optimization method for emergency supplies allocation problem with multisupplier, multiaffected area, multirelief, and multivehicle. The triplet of supply, demand, and the availability of path is unknown prior to the extraordinary event and is descriptive with fuzzy random variable. Considering the fairness, timeliness, and economical efficiency, a multiobjective expected value model is built for facility location, vehicle routing, and supply allocation decisions. The goals of proposed model aim to minimize the proportion of demand nonsatisfied and response time of emergency reliefs and the total cost of the whole process. When the demand and the availability of path are discrete, the expected values in the objective functions are converted into their equivalent forms. When the supply amount is continuous, the equilibrium chance in the constraint is transformed to its equivalent one. To overcome the computational difficulty caused by multiple objectives, a goal programming model is formulated to obtain a compromise solution. Finally, an example is presented to illustrate the validity of the proposed model and the effectiveness of the solution method.",X Bai,10.1155/2016/2823835,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/2823835,0,2016,Two-Stage Multiobjective Optimization for Emergency Supplies Allocation Problem under Integrated Uncertainty,['Mathematical Problems in Engineering'],"(['General Engineering', 'General Mathematics'],)",,Engineering

"UNLABELLEDIndividuals undergoing treatment for alcohol use disorders exhibit increased risk for impaired oral health. We conducted a study to assess oral health and demographic characteristics of inpatients under treatment for alcohol use disorders.MATERIALS AND METHODSThirty-four inpatients, 24 male and 10 female, with diverse ethnicity, were recruited in a rehabilitation center for alcohol use disorders in Buffalo, NY. Before undergoing oral examination, subjects completed a questionnaire on dental hygiene, associated behaviors, and demographic characteristics. Information regarding patients' oral health was collected using plaque, gingival, and decayed, missing or filled teeth (DMF) indices, and by examining soft tissue and evaluating signs of abrasion, erosion, and attrition. Statistical analysis determined prevalence and descriptive characteristics.RESULTSAlcohol intake for the population was, on average, 45.7 drinks/week, and 61.8% had smoked cigarettes within the past month. Patients were missing 15.1% of their teeth. Of teeth examined, 13.5% had dental caries. Prevalence of soft tissue abnormalities was 35.3%, prevalence of tooth erosion was 47.1%, and prevalence of moderate/severe gingival inflammation was 82.3%. Although study participants reported brushing at least once a day, 70.6% of subjects presented with heavy dental plaque accumulation. Most participants (85.3%) described the condition of their mouth and teeth as fair or poor. Finally, we observed a satisfactory participation rate among those who qualified for the study.CONCLUSIONOral examination showed significant levels of dental caries, gingival inflammation, soft tissue abnormalities, and tooth erosion. In addition, this study indicates that patients undergoing treatment for alcohol use disorders evidence poor oral health, and are at heightened risk for the development of periodontal disease.

"The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the acetic acid released by some silicone sealers during the curing process poses an increased risk for dental erosion, thus constituting an occupational hazard to exposed individuals. The material comprised 13 individuals (x=30 years, 10 men and 3 women) who had been exposed to an average of 4.2 years' (range 0.6-10 years) of working with silicone. Each had comprehensive medical and dental examinations carried out. A sex- and aged-matched group of 20 healthy, unexposed workers from the same company served as controls for the medical examination, while study models from randomly selected sex- and age-matched individuals were used as controls for assessing the severity of erosion. Using a questionnaire, an assessment of the role of various possible factors related to oral and general health, and to dental erosion in particular, was made for each participant in the exposed group. Clinical examination included recordings of severity of dental erosion, presence of ""cuppings"", DMFT, salivary secretion rate and buffer capacity, visible plaque index and gingival bleeding index. In addition, bitewing radiographs, study casts and intraoral colour transparencies were obtained for each individual. The severity of dental erosion was significantly higher in those exposed to silicone compared to controls. There was also a significant correlation between the period of exposure to silicone in the workplace and severity of erosion. Medical problems, especially with regard to upper respiratory tract symptoms, were significantly more common among exposed individuals than controls. In conclusion, a relationship between occupational exposure to acetic acid vapours from silicone sealers and development of dental erosion would appear to exist.

"There are a few documented case studies on the adverse effect of wine on both dental hard and soft tissues. Professional wine tasting could present some degree of increased risk to dental erosion. Alcoholic beverages with a low pH may cause erosion, particularly if the attack is of long duration, and repeated over time. The purpose of this study was to compare the prevalence and severity of tooth surface loss between winemakers (exposed) and their spouses (non-exposed). Utilising a cross-sectional, comparative study design, a clinical examination was conducted to assess caries status; the presence and severity of tooth surface loss; staining (presence or absence); fluorosis and prosthetic status. The salivary flow rate, buffering capacity and pH were also measured. Thirty-six persons, twenty-one winemakers and fifteen of their spouses participated in the study. It was possible to show that there was a difference in terms of the prevalence and severity of tooth surface loss between the teeth of winemakers and those who are not winemakers. The occurrence of tooth surface loss amongst winemakers was highly likely due to frequent exposure of their teeth to wine. Frequent exposure of the teeth to wine, as occurs among wine tasters, is deleterious to enamel, and constitutes an occupational hazard. Erosion is an occupational risk for wine tasters.

"Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of dental caries, developmental defects of enamel, and related factors in children with clefts. Design: This cross-sectional prevalence study used standard dental indices for assessment. Setting: Children underwent a dental examination under standard conditions of seating and lighting in the outpatient department of a dental hospital as part of an ongoing audit to monitor clinical outcomes. Participants: Ninety-one children aged 4, 8, and 12 years were included in the study. Outcome Measurements Dental caries were assessed by use of the decayed, missing, and filled index for primary teeth (dmft); Decayed, Missing, and Filled index for permanent teeth (DMFT) according to the criteria as used in the national survey of children's dental health in the United Kingdom (O'Brien, 1994). Developmental defects were assessed using the modified Developmental Defects of Enamel Index (Clarkson and O'Mullane, 1989). Dental erosion was assessed using the criteria derived for the national survey of children's dental health (O'Brien, 1994). Results: Caries prevalence increased with age; 63% of patients at 4 years and 34% at 12 years were caries free. The mean dmft for the 4-year-olds was 1.3 with a mean DMFT for the 12-year-olds of 1.8. All the 4-year-olds had evidence of erosion of enamel in the primary teeth (incisors and first molars) and 56% of the 12-year-olds had erosion of permanent teeth (incisors and first permanent molars). Developmental defects of enamel became more prevalent with age, with at least one opacity in 56% of 4-year-olds and 100% of 12-year-olds. Hypoplasia was not found in the primary dentition but affected permanent teeth in 38% of 8-year-olds and 23% of the 12-year-olds. Conclusion: This study has shown that dental disease is prevalent in these patients. These assessments not only provide a baseline on oral health parameters in young people with clefts but underline the need for a more aggressive approach to prevention of oral disease to optimize clinical outcome.","['J H Nunn', 'J R Chapple']",10.1597/1545-1569_2001_038_0525_tohocw_2.0.co_2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1597/1545-1569_2001_038_0525_tohocw_2.0.co_2,0,2001,"The oral health of children with clefts of the lip, palate, or both",['The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal'],"(['Otorhinolaryngology', 'Oral Surgery'],)",,Science

"Recurrent exposure to gastric acid as in children with bulimia and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may contribute to dental erosion. We performed a prospective study to evaluate the presence of GERD and dental erosions in children with primary and permanent dentition. Children undergoing elective endoscopy for possible GERD (n = 37) underwent evaluation of their teeth for the presence, severity, and pattern of erosion and stage of dentition: 24 patients had GERD. Dental erosions were identified in 20; all had GERD. Erosion patterns showed more involvement of the posterior teeth.

"The literature on the topic has shown a strong correlation between the degree of precision of face localization and the face recognition performance. Hence, there is a need for precise facial feature detectors, as well as objective measures for their evaluation and comparison.  In this paper, we will present significant improvements to a previous method for precise eye center localization, by integrating a module for mouth localization. The technique is based on Support Vector Machines trained on optimally chosen Haar wavelet coefficients. The method has been tested on several public databases; the results are reported and compared according to a standard error measure. The tests show that the algorithm achieves high precision of localization.","['G Lipori', 'R Lanzarotti', 'P Campadelli']",10.1142/s0218001409007259,http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/s0218001409007259,5,2009,PRECISE EYE AND MOUTH LOCALIZATION,['International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence'],"(['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Software'],)",,Artificial Intelligence/Robotics

"This article describes research that aims to encourage physical activity through a novel pervasive gaming paradigm. Data from a wearable accelerometer are logged wirelessly to a cell phone and control the animation of an avatar that represents the player in a virtual race game with other players over the cellular network. Winners are declared every day and players with an excess of activity points can spend some to get hints in mental games of the suite, like Sudoku. The racing game runs in the background throughout the day and every little move counts. As the gaming platform is embedded in the daily routine of players, it may act as a strong behavioral modifier and increase everyday physical activity other than volitional sporting exercise. Such physical activity (e.g., taking the stairs), is termed NEAT and was shown to play a major role in obesity prevention and intervention. A pilot experiment demonstrates that players are engaged in NEAT-o-Games and become more physically active while having a good dosage of fun.","['James Levine', 'Ioannis Pavlidis', 'Pradeep Buddharaju', 'Colin Puri', 'Konstantinos Kazakos', 'Yuichi Fujiki']",10.1145/1371216.1371224,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1371216.1371224,7,2008,NEAT-o-Games,['Computers in Entertainment'],"(['Computer Science Applications'],)",,Science

"This study investigates the relationship between CO2 emissions, economic growth, energy use and electricity production by hydroelectric sources in Brazil. To verify the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis we use time-series data for the period 1971-2011. The autoregressive distributed lag methodology was used to test for cointegration in the long run. Additionally, the vector error correction model Granger causality test was applied to verify the predictive value of independent variables. Empirical results find that there is a quadratic long run relationship between CO2emissions and economic growth, confirming the existence of an EKC for Brazil. Furthermore, energy use shows increasing effects on emissions, while electricity production by hydropower sources has an inverse relationship with environmental degradation. The short run model does not provide evidence for the EKC theory. The differences between the results in the long and short run models can be considered for establishing environmental policies. This suggests that special attention to both variables-energy use and the electricity production by hydroelectric sources- could be an effective way to mitigate CO2 emissions in Brazil Collapse","['M J Mendoza-Jimenez', 'J Aguilar-Bohorquez', 'I Valverde-Bajana', 'M A Zambrano-Monserrate']",,,0,2016,Relationship between economic growth and environmental degradation: is there evidence of an environmental Kuznets curve for Brazil?,International Journal of Energy Economics and Policy,,Economics,Science

"<jats:title content-type=""-heading"">Purpose                – The purpose of this paper is to analyse the implication of trade on carbon emissions in a panel of eight highly trading Southeast and East Asian countries, namely, China, Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, Hong Kong, The Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.                                        <jats:title content-type=""-heading"">Design/methodology/approach                – The analysis relies on the standard quadratic environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) extended to include energy consumption and international trade. A battery of panel unit root and co-integration tests is applied to establish the variables’ stochastic properties and their long-run relations. Then, the specified EKC is estimated using the panel dynamic ordinary least square (OLS) estimation technique.                                        <jats:title content-type=""-heading"">Findings                – The panel co-integration statistics verifies the validity of the extended EKC for the countries under study. Estimation of the long-run EKC via the dynamic OLS estimation method reveals the environmentally degrading effects of trade in these countries, especially in ASEAN and plus South Korea and Hong Kong.                                        <jats:title content-type=""-heading"">Practical implications                – These countries are heavily dependent on trade for their development processes, and as such, their impacts on CO2 emissions would be highly relevant for assessing their trade policies, along the line of the gain-from-trade hypothesis, the race-to-the-bottom hypothesis and the pollution-safe-haven hypothesis.                                        <jats:title content-type=""-heading"">Originality/value                – The analysis adds to existing literature by focusing on the highly trading nations of Southeast and East Asian countries. The results suggest that reassessment of trade policies in these countries is much needed and it must go beyond the sole pursuit of economic development via trade.","['Syed Aun R Rizvi', 'Mansor H Ibrahim']",10.1108/ijccsm-11-2013-0131,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/ijccsm-11-2013-0131,11,2015,Emissions and trade in Southeast and East Asian countries: a panel co-integration analysis,['International Journal of Climate Change Strategies and Management'],"(['Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Development', 'Geography, Planning and Development', 'Global and Planetary Change'],)",,Construction Engineering/management

"The paper considers the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) as the main variable of climate change and gross domestic product (GDP), using the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) technique. At early stages of economic growth, EKC indicates the increase of pollution related to the growing use of resources. However, when a certain level of income per capita is reached, the trend reverses and at a higher stage of development, further economic growth leads to improvement of the environment. According to the researchers, this implies that the environmental impact indicator is an inverted U-shaped function of income per capita. In this paper, the cubic equation is used to empirically check the validity of the EKC relationship for European countries. The analysis is based on the survey of EU-27, Norway and Switzerland in the period of 1995–2010. The data is taken from the Eurostat database. To gain some insights into the environmental trends in each country, the article highlights the specific relationship in the country based on the level of its development. The similarities between individual countries are analysed in order to identify their basic common features.","['Pranas Vaitkus', 'Manuela Tvaronavičienė', 'Giedrė Lapinskienė']",10.3846/20294913.2014.881434,http://dx.doi.org/10.3846/20294913.2014.881434,3,2014,GREENHOUSE GASES EMISSIONS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH – EVIDENCE SUBSTANTIATING THE PRESENCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL KUZNETS CURVE IN THE EU,['Technological and Economic Development of Economy'],"(['Finance'],)",,Science

"Recent empirical research has examined the relationship between certain   indicators of environmental degradation and income, concluding that in some   cases an inverted U-shaped relationship, which has been called an   environmental Kuznets curve (EKC), exists between these variables. The source   of growth explanation is important for two reasons. First, it demonstrates   how the pollution consequences of growth depend on the source of growth.   Therefore, the analogy drawn by some in the environmental community between   the damaging effects of economic development and those of liberalized trade   is, at best, incomplete. Second, the source of growth explanation   demonstrates that a strong policy response to income gains is not necessary   for pollution to fall with growth. The aim of this paper investigates the   role of differences source of growth in environmental quality of Iran. The   results show the two growth resources in Iran cause, in the early stages, CO2   emission decreases until turning point but beyond this level of income per   capita, economic growth leads to environmental degradation.

"Concern about global climate change has elicited responses from governments around the world. These responses began with the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and have continued with other negotiations, including the 2009 Copenhagen Summit. These negotiations raised important questions about whether countries will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and, if so, how the burden of emissions reductions will be shared. To investigate these questions, we utilize environmental Kuznets curves for carbon emissions for the G8 plus five main developing countries. Our findings raise doubts about the feasibility of reducing global carbon emissions and shed light on the different positions taken by countries on the distribution of emissions reductions.","['Bruce Yandle', 'Jody W Lipford']",10.1017/s1355770x10000124,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s1355770x10000124,7,2010,"Environmental Kuznets curves, carbon emissions, and public choice",['Environment and Development Economics'],"(['Economics and Econometrics', 'General Environmental Science', 'Development'],)",,Econometrics

"This study is the first systematic attempt to test statistically the contrasting hypotheses on the emission of SO2 and CO2, and energy consumption in Japan and China for the last few decades. We postulate the hypotheses that local governments have incentives to internalize the local external diseconomies caused by SO2 emissions, but not the global external diseconomies caused by CO2 emissions. To substantiate our hypotheses, we decompose emissions of SO2 and CO2 into two factors: the emission factor (i.e. emission per energy use) and energy consumption. The results show that the prefectures where past energy consumption was high tend to reduce the emission factor of SO2 significantly in Japan, while we do not find such a tendency in China. There is also evidence that neither per capita income nor past energy consumption affects the CO2 emission factor and energy consumption significantly in both Japan and China, implying that an individual country has few incentives to reduce CO2 emissions.","['Keijiro Otsuka', 'Tetsushi Sonobe', 'Yue Yaguchi']",10.1017/s1355770x07003592,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s1355770x07003592,6,2007,Beyond the Environmental Kuznets Curve: a comparative study of SO2 and CO2 emissions between Japan and China,['Environment and Development Economics'],"(['Economics and Econometrics', 'General Environmental Science', 'Development'],)",,Econometrics
"The second half of the twentieth century emerged with two      important concepts of the economic world. In the start of the second      half, economists, developmentalists, etc., introduced the idea of      “development”, while; latter it was replaced by a more meaningful and      attractive term “sustainable development”. Sustainable development is      defined as “balancing the fulfillment of human needs with the protection      of the natural environment so that these needs can be met not only in      the present, but also in the indefinite future” [Wikipedia (2007)]. Or      “Sustainable development means that pattern of development that permits      future generations to live at least as well as the current generation”      [Todaro and Smith (2005)], eighth edition]. The field of sustainable      development can be conceptually broken into four constituent parts:      environmental sustainability, economic sustainability, social      sustainability and political sustainability.

"Most environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) theories do not apply to carbon dioxide (CO2 )—an unregulated, invisible, odorless gas with no direct human health effects. This analysis addresses the hypothesis that the income-CO2 relationship reflects changes in the composition of an economy as it develops and the associated role of trade in an emissions-intensive good (e.g., electricity). To test this hypothesis, I use a novel data set of 1960 to 1999 state-level CO2 emissions to estimate pretrade (production-based) CO2 EKCs and posttrade (consumption-based) CO2 EKCs. Based on the first EKC analysis of CO2 emissions in the United States, I find that consumption-based EKCs peak at significantly higher incomes than production-based EKCs, suggesting that emissions-intensive trade drives, at least in part, the income-emissions relationship. I have also investigated the robustness of the estimated income-CO2 relationship through a variety of specifications. Estimated EKCs appear to vary by state, and the estimated income-emissions relationships could be spurious for some states with nonstationary income and emissions data. Finally, I find that cold winters, warm summers, and historic coal endowments are positively associated with states’ CO2 emissions.",J E Aldy,10.1177/1070496504273514,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1070496504273514,3,2005,An Environmental Kuznets Curve Analysis of U.S. State-Level Carbon Dioxide Emissions,['The Journal of Environment & Development'],"(['Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Development', 'Geography, Planning and Development'],)",,Construction Engineering/management

"Environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) analysis links changes in environmental quality to national economic growth. The reduced form models, however, do not provide insight into the underlying processes that generate these changes. We compare EKC models to structural transition models of per capita CO2 emissions and per capita GDP, and find that, for the 16 countries which have undergone such a transition, the initiation of the transition correlates not with income levels but with historic events related to the oil price shocks of the 1970s and the policies that followed them. In contrast to previous EKC studies of CO2 the transition away from positive emissions elasticities for these 16 countries is found to occur as a sudden, discontinuous transition rather than as a gradual change. We also demonstrate that the third order polynomial 'N' dependence of emissions on income is the result of data aggregation. We conclude that neither the 'U'- nor the 'N'-shaped relationship between CO2 emissions and income provide a reliable indication of future behaviour.","['Gregory C Unruh', 'William R Moomaw']",10.1017/s1355770x97000247,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s1355770x97000247,11,1997,Are environmental Kuznets curves misleading us?

"This paper examines the relationship between per capita income and a wide range of environmental indicators using cross-country panel sets. The manner in which this has been done overcomes several of the weaknesses asscociated with the estimation of environmental Kuznets curves (EKCs). outlined by Stern et al. (1996). Results suggest that meaningful EKCs exist only for local air pollutants whilst indicators with a more global, or indirect, impact either increase monotonically with income or else have predicted turning points at high per capita income levels with large standard errors – unless they have been subjected to a multilateral policy initiative. Two other findings are also made: that concentration of local pollutants in urban areas peak at a lower per capita income level than total emissions per capita; and that transport-generated local air pollutants peak at a higher per capita income level than total emissions per capita. Given these findings, suggestions are made regarding the necessary future direction of environmental policy.","['J M Bates', 'A J Rayner', 'M A Cole']",10.1017/s1355770x97000211,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s1355770x97000211,11,1997,The environmental Kuznets curve: an empirical analysis,['Environment and Development Economics'],"(['Economics and Econometrics', 'General Environmental Science', 'Development'],)",,Econometrics

"Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems have become a de facto standard for integrating business functions. But an obvious question arises: if every business is using the same socalled “Vanilla” software (e.g. an SAP ERP system) what happens to the competitive advantage from implementing IT systems? If we discard our custom-built legacy systems in favour of enterprise systems do we also jettison our valued competitive advantage from IT? While for some organisations ERPs have become just a necessity for conducting business, others want to exploit them to outperform their competitors. In the last few years, researchers have begun to study the link between ERP systems and competitive advantage. This link will be the focus of this paper. We outline a framework summarizing prior research and suggest two researchable questions. A future article will develop the framework with two empirical case studies from within part of the European food industry.

"Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Indonesia contribute around 53% of the GDP. To increase their market competitiveness, SMEs need to be able to integrate and automate their business processes at least to a certain extent. An ERP system can be a solution for SMEs because of its advantages i.e. quickened information response time, increased interaction across the enterprise, improved order management/cycle, etc. Among the critical issues of SMEs are limited funds availability and lack of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) capability. In order to better understand the need of ERP services for SMEs and to provide guidelines for Indonesian SMEs and to address the void of ERP researches in Indonesia, this paper presents the roadmap of ERP research agenda for SMEs in Indonesia.

"Organizations perceive ERP as a vital tool for organizational competition as it integrates dispersed organizational systems and enables flawless transactions and production. This review examines studies investigating Critical Success Factors (CSFs) in implementing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Keywords relating to the theme of this study were defined and used to search known Web engines and journal databases for studies on both implementing ERP systems per se and integrating ERP systems with other well- known systems (e.g., SCM, CRM) whose importance to business organizations and academia is acknowledged to work in a complementary fashion. A total of 341 articles were reviewed to address three main goals. This study structures previous research by presenting a comprehensive taxonomy of CSFs in the area of ERP. Second, it maps studies, identified through an exhaustive and comprehensive literature review, to different dimensions and facets of ERP system implementation. Third, it presents studies investigating CSFs in terms of a specific ERP lifecycle phase and across the entire ERP life cycle. This study not only reviews articles in which an ERP system is the sole or primary field of research, but also articles that refer to an integration of ERP systems and other popular systems (e.g., SCM, CRM). Finally it provides a comprehensive bibliography of the articles published during this period that can serve as a guide for future research.","['Doron Tauber', 'Levi Shaul']",10.1145/2501654.2501669,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2501654.2501669,8,2013,Critical success factors in enterprise resource planning systems,['ACM Computing Surveys'],"(['General Computer Science', 'Theoretical Computer Science'],)",,Science

"The Implementation of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems require huge investments while ineffective implementations of such projects are commonly observed. A considerable number of these projects have been reported to fail or take longer than it was initially planned, while previous studies show that the aim of rapid implementation of such projects has not been successful and the failure of the fundamental goals in these projects have imposed huge amounts of costs on investors. Some of the major consequences are the reduction in demand for such products and the introduction of further skepticism to the managers and investors of ERP systems. In this regard, it is important to understand the factors determining success or failure of ERP implementation. The aim of this paper is to study the critical success factors (CSFs) in implementing ERP systems and to develop a conceptual model which can serve as a basis for ERP project managers. These critical success factors that are called “core critical success factors” are extracted from 62 published papers using the content analysis and the entropy method. The proposed conceptual model has been verified in the context of five multinational companies.","['Nicholas Standage', 'Shabnam Dadbin', 'Roya Gholami', 'Payam Hanafizadeh']",10.4018/jeis.2010040105,http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/jeis.2010040105,4,2010,The Core Critical Success Factors in Implementation of Enterprise Resource Planning Systems,['International Journal of Enterprise Information Systems'],"(['Information Systems and Management', 'Computer Science Applications', 'Management Information Systems'],)",,Science

": ERP systems are typically the largest, most complex, and most demanding information systems implemented by firms, representing a major departure from the individual and departmental information systems prevalent in the past. Firms and individuals are extensively impacted, and many problematic issues remain to be researched. ERP and related integrated technologies are a transformative force on the accounting profession. As the nature of business evolves, accounting expertise is being called on to make broader contributions such as reporting on nonfinancial measures, auditing information systems, implementing management controls within information systems, and providing management consulting services. This review of ERP research is drawn from an extensive examination of the breadth of ERP-related literature without constraints as to a narrow timeframe or limited journal list, although particular attention is directed to the leading journals in information systems and accounting information systems. Early research consisted of descriptive studies of firms implementing ERP systems. Then researchers started to address other research questions about the factors that lead to successful implementations: the need for change management and expanded forms of user education, whether the financial benefit outweighed the cost, and whether the issues are different depending on organizational type and cultural factors. This research encouraged the development of several major ERP research areas: (1) critical success factors, (2) the organizational impact, and (3) the economic impact of ERP systems. We use this taxonomy to establish (1) what we know, (2) what we need, and (3) where we are going in ERP research. The objective of this review is to synthesize the extant ERP research reported without regard to publication domain and make this readily available to accounting researchers. We organize key ERP research by topics of interest in accounting, and map ERP topics onto existing accounting information systems research areas. An emphasis is placed on topics important to accounting, including (but not limited to) the risk management and auditing of ERP systems, regulatory issues, the internal and external economic impacts of ERP systems, extensions needed in ERP systems for XBRL, for interorganizational support, and for the design of management control systems.

"Release Planning is an important and complex activity in software development. It involves several aspects related to which functionalities are going to be developed in each release of the system. Consistent planning must meet the customers’ needs and comply with existing constraints. Optimization techniques have been successfully applied to solve problems in the Software Engineering field, including the Software Release Planning Problem. In this context, this work presents an approach based on multiobjective optimization for the problem when the number of releases is not known a priori or when the number of releases is a value expected by stakeholders. The strategy regards on the stakeholders’ satisfaction, business value and risk management, as well as provides ways for handling requirements interdependencies. Experiments show the feasibility of the proposed approach.","['M I Cortés', 'J T De Souza', 'F G De Freitas', 'T G N Da Silva', 'M M A Brasil']",10.5220/0003510100970107,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ec0f9ca8af87ce66f394a9dd9725d1921f2625a6,0,2011,A Multiobjective Optimization Approach to the Software Release Planning with Undefined Number of Releases and Interdependent Requirements,ICEIS,,['Computer Science'],Computer Sciences

"Background            Undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma (UES) of liver is a rare malignant neoplasm, which affects mostly the pediatric population accounting for 13% of pediatric hepatic malignancies, a few cases has been reported in adults.                                Case presentation            We report a case of undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma of the liver in a 20-year-old Caucasian male. The patient was referred to us for further investigation after a laparotomy in a district hospital for spontaneous abdominal hemorrhage, which was due to a liver mass. After a through evaluation with computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging of the liver and taking into consideration the previous history of the patient, it was decided to surgically explore the patient. Resection of I–IV and VIII hepatic lobe. Patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation one day after the surgery and died the next day.                                Conclusion            It is a rare, highly malignant hepatic neoplasm, affecting almost exclusively the pediatric population. The prognosis is poor but recent evidence has shown that long-term survival is possible after complete surgical resection with or without postoperative chemotherapy.","['Christos Antiochos', 'Dimitra Rontogianni', 'George Micros', 'Themistoclis Georgantas', 'Ioannis Panagiotou', 'Timothy Sakellaridis']",10.1186/1477-7819-4-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1477-7819-4-9,0,2006,Undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma of the liver mimicking acute appendicitis.

"This paper focuses on the optimization of container shipping network and its operations under changing cargo demand and freight rates. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer non-linear programming problem (MINP) with an objective of maximizing the average unit ship-slot profit at three stages using analytical methodology. The issues such as empty container repositioning, ship-slot allocating, ship sizing, and container configuration are simultaneously considered based on a series of the matrices of demand for a year. To solve the model, a bi-level genetic algorithm based method is proposed. Finally, numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the validity of the proposed model and algorithms. The obtained results show that the suggested model can provide a more realistic solution to the issues on the basis of changing demand and freight rates and arrange a more effective approach to the optimization of container shipping network structures and operations than does the model based on the average demand.","['Q Zeng', 'C Chao']",10.3846/transport.2010.07,http://dx.doi.org/10.3846/transport.2010.07,0,2010,Designing container shipping network under changing demand and freight rates,['TRANSPORT'],"(['Mechanical Engineering', 'Automotive Engineering'],)",,Engineering

"A liner shipping company seeks to provide liner services with shorter transit time compared with the benchmark of market-level transit time because of the ever-increasing competition. When the itineraries of its liner service routes are determined, the liner shipping company designs the schedules of the liner routes such that the wait time at transshipment ports is minimized. As a result of transshipment, multiple paths are available for delivering containers from the origin port to the destination port. Therefore, the medium-term (3 to 6 months) schedule design problem and the operational-level container-routing problem must be investigated simultaneously. The schedule design and container-routing problems were formulated by minimization of the sum of the total transshipment cost and penalty cost associated with longer transit time than the market-level transit time, minus the bonus for shorter transit time. The formulation is nonlinear, noncontinuous, and nonconvex. A genetic local search approach was developed to find good solutions to the problem. The proposed solution method was applied to optimize the Asia–Europe–Oceania liner shipping services of a global liner company.","['Qiang Meng', 'Shuaian Wang']",10.3141/2222-04,http://dx.doi.org/10.3141/2222-04,1,2011,Schedule Design and Container Routing in Liner Shipping,['Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board'],"(['Mechanical Engineering', 'Civil and Structural Engineering'],)",,Structural Engineering

"We describe a case of duodenal gangliocytic paraganglioma showing lymph node metastasis. A 61-year-old Japanese man underwent pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy to remove a tumor at the papilla of Vater. The section of the tumor extending from the mucosa to submucosa of the duodenum was sharply demarcated, solid, and white-yellowish. Neither necrosis nor hemorrhage was present. Histological examination confirmed the immunohistochemical identification of three components comprising epithelioid cells, spindle-shaped cells, and ganglion-like cells. Epithelioid cells showed positive reactivity for synaptophysin, somatostatin, and CD56. In contrast, spindle-shaped cells showed positive reactivity for S-100 protein, but not for synaptophysin, somatostatin or CD56. Furthermore, we found lymph node metastasis despite lack of bcl-2 and p53 expression. In addition to the rarity of the tumor, we are describing here the present case suggests the malignant potency of the tumor despite lack of acceptable prognostic indicators for neuroendocrine tumor.","['Kazutoshi Shibuya', 'Tetsuo Nemoto', 'Daisuke Sasai', 'Chikako Hasegawa', 'Megumi Wakayama', 'Aki Mituda', 'Masaru Tuchiya', 'Tomoyuki Yokose', 'Yoichiro Okubo']",10.1186/1746-1596-5-27,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1746-1596-5-27,0,2010,Duodenal gangliocytic paraganglioma showing lymph node metastasis: A rare case report,['Diagnostic Pathology'],"(['General Medicine', 'Histology', 'Pathology and Forensic Medicine'],)",,Pathology

"A variety of platforms, such as micro-unmanned vehicles, are limited in the amount of computational hardware they can support due to weight and power constraints. An efficient stereo vision algorithm implemented on an FPGA would be able to minimize payload and power consumption in microunmanned vehicles, while providing 3D information and still leaving computational resources available for other processing tasks. This work presents a hardware design of the efficient profile shape matching stereo vision algorithm. Hardware resource usage is presented for the targeted micro-UV platform, Helio-copter, that uses the Xilinx Virtex 4 FX60 FPGA. Less than a fifth of the resources on this FGPA were used to produce dense disparity maps for image sizes up to 450 × 375, with the ability to scale up easily by increasing BRAM usage. A comparison is given of accuracy, speed performance, and resource usage of a census transform-based stereo vision FPGA implementation by Jin et al. Results show that the profile shape matching algorithm is an efficient real-time stereo vision algorithm for hardware implementation for resource limited systems such as microunmanned vehicles.","['James K Archibald', 'Kirt Lillywhite', 'Dah Jye Lee', 'Beau Tippetts']",10.1155/2014/945926,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/945926,0,2014,Hardware-Efficient Design of Real-Time Profile Shape Matching Stereo Vision Algorithm on FPGA,['International Journal of Reconfigurable Computing'],"(['Hardware and Architecture'],)",,Science

"In this article, we present a fast and high quality stereo matching algorithm on FPGA using cost aggregation (CA) and fast locally consistent (FLC) dense stereo. In many software programs, global matching algorithms are used in order to obtain accurate disparity maps. Although their error rates are considerably low, their processing speeds are far from that required for real-time processing because of their complex processing sequences. In order to realize real-time processing, many hardware systems have been proposed to date. They have achieved considerably high processing speeds; however, their error rates are not as good as those of software programs, because simple local matching algorithms have been widely used in those systems. In our system, sophisticated local matching algorithms (CA and FLC) that are suitable for FPGA implementation are used to achieve low error rate while maintaining the high processing speed. We evaluate the performance of our circuit on Xilinx Vertex-6 FPGAs. Its error rate is comparable to that of top-level software algorithms, and its processing speed is nearly 2 clock cycles per pixel, which reaches 507.9 fps for 640 480 pixel images.","['Tsutomu Maruyama', 'Minxi Jin']",10.1145/2567659,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2567659,2,2014,Fast and Accurate Stereo Vision System on FPGA,['ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems'],"(['General Computer Science'],)",,Science

"Recent architectural trends have focused on increased parallelism via multicore processors and increased heterogeneity via accelerator devices (e.g., graphics-processing units, field-programmable gate arrays). Although these architectures have significant performance and energy potential, application designers face many device-specific challenges when choosing an appropriate accelerator or when customizing an algorithm for an accelerator. To help address this problem, in this article we thoroughly evaluate convolution, one of the most common operations in digital-signal processing, on multicores, graphics-processing units, and field-programmable gate arrays.

"Dense stereo correspondence enabling reconstruction of depth information in a scene is of great importance in the field of computer vision. Recently, some local solutions based on matching cost filtering with an edge-preserving filter have been proved to be capable of achieving more accuracy than global approaches. Unfortunately, the computational complexity of these algorithms is quadratically related to the window size used to aggregate the matching costs. The recent trend has been to pursue higher accuracy with greater efficiency in execution. Therefore, this paper proposes a new cost-aggregation module to compute the matching responses for all the image pixels at a set of sampling points generated by a hierarchical clustering algorithm. The complexity of this implementation is linear both in the number of image pixels and the number of clusters. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art local methods in terms of both accuracy and speed. Moreover, performance tests indicate that parameters such as the height of the hierarchical binary tree and the spatial and range standard deviations have a significant influence on time consumption and the accuracy of disparity maps.","['Zhaocai Du', 'Yanbin Yao', 'Fang Zou', 'Xiaoping Lou', 'Naiguang Lu', 'Yimin Lin']",10.1155/2013/654139,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/654139,0,2013,Matching Cost Filtering for Dense Stereo Correspondence,['Mathematical Problems in Engineering'],"(['General Engineering', 'General Mathematics'],)",,Engineering

"Background Previous studies have demonstrated a correlation between surgical experience and performance on a virtual reality arthroscopy simulator but only provided single time point evaluations. Additional longitudinal studies are necessary to confirm the validity of virtual reality simulation before these teaching aids can be more fully recommended for surgical education. Hypothesis Subjects will show improved performance on simulator retesting several years after an initial baseline evaluation, commensurate with their advanced surgical experience. Study Design Controlled laboratory study. Methods After gaining further arthroscopic experience, 10 orthopaedic residents underwent retesting 3 years after initial evaluation on a Procedicus virtual reality arthroscopy simulator. Using a paired t test, simulator parameters were compared in each subject before and after additional arthroscopic experience. Subjects were evaluated for time to completion, number of probe collisions with the tissues, average probe velocity, and distance traveled with the tip of the simulated probe compared to an optimal computer-determined distance. In addition, to evaluate consistency of simulator performance, results were compared to historical controls of equal experience. Results Subjects improved significantly ( P &lt; .02 for all) in the 4 simulator parameters: completion time (−51 %), probe collisions (−29%), average velocity (+122%), and distance traveled (−;32%). With the exception of probe velocity, there were no significant differences between the performance of this group and that of a historical group with equal experience, indicating that groups with similar arthroscopic experience consistently demonstrate equivalent scores on the simulator. Conclusion Subjects significantly improved their performance on simulator retesting 3 years after initial evaluation. Additionally, across independent groups with equivalent surgical experience, similar performance can be expected on simulator parameters; thus it may eventually be possible to establish simulator benchmarks to indicate likely arthroscopic skill. Clinical Relevance These results further validate the use of surgical simulation as an important tool for the evaluation of surgical skills.","['J J Warner', 'B Forsythe', 'G Pappas', 'A H Gomoll']",10.1177/0363546508314406,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0363546508314406,0,2008,Individual Skill Progression on a Virtual Reality Simulator for Shoulder Arthroscopy A 3-Year Follow-up Study,['The American Journal of Sports Medicine'],"(['Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation', 'Orthopedics and Sports Medicine'],)",,Science
"Background The traditional process of surgical education is being increasingly challenged by economic constraints and concerns about patient safety. Sophisticated computer-based devices have become available to simulate the surgical experience in a protected environment. As with any new educational tool, these devices have generated controversy about the validity of the training experience. Hypothesis Performance on a virtual reality simulator correlates with actual surgical experience. Study Design Controlled laboratory study. Methods Forty-three test subjects of various experience levels in shoulder arthroscopy were tested on an arthroscopy simulator according to a standardized protocol. Subjects were evaluated for time to completion, distance traveled with the tip of the simulated probe compared with a computer-determined optimal distance, average probe velocity, and number of probe collisions with the tissues. Results Subjects were grouped according to prior experience with shoulder arthroscopy. Comparing the least experienced with most experienced groups, the average time to completion decreased by 62% from 128.8 seconds to 49.2 seconds; path length and hook collisions were more than halved from 8.2 to 3.8 and 34.1 to 16.8, respectively; and average probe velocity more than doubled from 0.18 to 0.4 cm/second. There were no significant differences for any parameter tested between subjects with video game experience compared to those without. Conclusions The study demonstrated a close and statistically significant correlation between simulator results and surgical experience, thus confirming the hypothesis. Conversely, experience with video games was not associated with improved simulator performance. This indicates that the skill set tested may be similar to the one developed in the operating room, thus suggesting its use as a potential tool for future evaluation of surgical trainees. Clinical Relevance The results have implications for the future of orthopaedic surgical training programs, the majority of which have not embraced virtual reality technology for physician education.","['J J Warner', 'J Czarnecki', 'R V O’toole', 'A H Gomoll']",10.1177/0363546506296521,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0363546506296521,0,2007,Surgical experience correlates with performance on a virtual reality simulator for shoulder arthroscopy,['The American Journal of Sports Medicine'],"(['Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation', 'Orthopedics and Sports Medicine'],)",,Science

"Background            Adaptive game software has been successful in remediation of dyslexia. Here we describe the cognitive and algorithmic principles underlying the development of similar software for dyscalculia. Our software is based on current understanding of the cerebral representation of number and the hypotheses that dyscalculia is due to a ""core deficit"" in number sense or in the link between number sense and symbolic number representations.                                Methods            ""The Number Race"" software trains children on an entertaining numerical comparison task, by presenting problems adapted to the performance level of the individual child. We report full mathematical specifications of the algorithm used, which relies on an internal model of the child's knowledge in a multidimensional ""learning space"" consisting of three difficulty dimensions: numerical distance, response deadline, and conceptual complexity (from non-symbolic numerosity processing to increasingly complex symbolic operations).                                Results            The performance of the software was evaluated both by mathematical simulations and by five weeks of use by nine children with mathematical learning difficulties. The results indicate that the software adapts well to varying levels of initial knowledge and learning speeds. Feedback from children, parents and teachers was positive. A companion article [1] describes the evolution of number sense and arithmetic scores before and after training.                                Conclusion            The software, open-source and freely available online, is designed for learning disabled children aged 5–8, and may also be useful for general instruction of normal preschool children. The learning algorithm reported is highly general, and may be applied in other domains.","['D Cohen', 'L Cohen', 'S Revkin', 'P Pinel', 'S Dehaene', 'A Wilson']",10.1186/1744-9081-2-19,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1744-9081-2-19,0,2006,"Principles underlying the design of “The Number Race”, an adaptive computer game for remediation of dyscalculia",['Behavioral and Brain Functions'],"(['Behavioral Neuroscience', 'Biological Psychiatry', 'Cognitive Neuroscience', 'General Medicine'],)",,Science

"The use of computer games and virtual environments has been shown to engage and motivate students and can provide opportunities to visualize the historical period and make sense of complex visual information. This article presents the results of a study in which university students were asked to collaboratively solve inquiry-based problems related to historical disease epidemics using game-based learning. A multimethod approach to the data collection was used. Initial results indicated that students attended to visual information with more specificity than text-based information when using a virtual environment. Models of student’s decision-making processes when interacting with the world confirmed that students were making decisions related to these visual elements, and not the inquiry process. Building on theories from the learning sciences, such as learning from animations/visualizations and computer-supported collaborative learning, in this article, the authors begin to answer the question of why students learned what they did about historical disease epidemics.","['K Thompson', 'S Kennedy-Clark']",10.1177/1555412011431361,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1555412011431361,0,2011,"What Do Students Learn When Collaboratively Using A Computer Game in the Study of Historical Disease Epidemics, and Why?",['Games and Culture'],"(['Human-Computer Interaction', 'Applied Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)', 'Anthropology', 'Communication', 'Cultural Studies'],)",,Arts and Humanities

"Purpose - This study attempts to re-investigate the electricity consumption function for Malaysia through the cointegration and causality analyses over the period 1970 to 2005. Design/methodology/approach - The study employed the bounds-testing procedure for cointegration to examine the potential long-run relationship, while an autoregressive distributed lag model is used to derive the short- and long-run coefficients. The Granger causality test is applied to determine the causality direction between electricity consumption and its determinants. Findings - New evidence is found in this study: first, electricity consumption, income, foreign direct investment, and population in Malaysia are cointegrated. Second, the influx of foreign direct investment and population growth are positively related to electricity consumption in Malaysia and the Granger causality evidence indicates that electricity consumption, income, and foreign direct investment are of bilateral causality. Originality/value - The estimated multivariate electricity consumption function for Malaysia implies that Malaysia is an energy-dependent country; thus energy-saving policies may have an inverse effect on current and also future economic development in Malaysia.",C F Tang,10.1108/01443580910973583,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/69e2c21ce6ab610bb1b1538ca4555cd2b5b3bc0a,0,2009,"Electricity consumption, income, foreign direct investment, and population in Malaysia: new evidence from multivariate framework analysis",,,['Economics'],Science

"This paper examines the causal relationship between GDP and energy use for the period 1947-90 in the USA. The relationship between energy use and economic growth has been examined by both biophysical and neoclassical economists. In particular, several studies have tested for the presence of a causal relationship (in the Granger sense) between energy use and economic growth. However, these tests do not allow a direct test of the relative explanatory powers of the neoclassical and biophysical models. A multivariate adaptation of the test-vector autoregression (VAR) does allow such a test. A VAR of GDP, energy use, capital stock and employment is estimated and Granger tests for causal relationships between the variables are carried out. Although there is no evidence that gross energy use Granger causes GDP, a measure of final energy use adjusted for changing fuel composition does Granger cause GDP.",D I Stern,10.1016/0140-9883(93)90033-n,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dc3b4daeb841171452d20cfb93b71a7ac0b3d2fb,0,1993,Energy and economic growth in the USA.

In a single-pass U-type counterflow PHE, three different chevron plate arrangements are considered: two symmetric plate arrangements with β = 30 deg/30 deg and 60 deg/60 deg, and one mixed-plate arrangement with β = 30 deg/60 deg. For water (2 &lt; Pr &lt; 6) flow rates in the 600 &lt; Re &lt; 104 regime, data for Nu and f are presented. The results show significant effects of both the chevron angle β and surface area enlargement factor φ. As β increases, and compared to a flat-plate pack, up to two to five times higher Nu are obtained; the concomitant f, however, are 13 to 44 times higher. Increasing φ also has a similar, though smaller effect. Based on experimental data for Re a 7000 and 30 deg ≤ β ≤ 60 deg, predictive correlations of the form Nu = C1,(β) D1(φ) Rep1(β)Pr1/3(μ/μw)0.14 and f = C2(β) D2(φ) Rep2(β) are devised. Finally, at constant pumping power, and depending upon Re, β, and φ, the heat transfer is found to be enhanced by up to 2.8 times that in an equivalent flat-plate channel.","['R M Manglik', 'A Muley']",10.1115/1.2825923,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.2825923,2,1999,Experimental Study of Turbulent Flow Heat Transfer and Pressure Drop in a Plate Heat Exchanger With Chevron Plates,['Journal of Heat Transfer'],"(['Mechanical Engineering', 'Mechanics of Materials', 'Condensed Matter Physics', 'General Materials Science'],)",,Science

"Experiments on the relaxation of residual stresses in steels by fatigue loading are described. This question is of interest because it is well known that compressive residual stresses are often induced by special surface treatments (such as shot peening) to improve the fatigue life of metal parts; however, if cyclic relaxation occurs, the beneficial effects can, in part, vanish during service. Two hardened and tempered steels of grade C45 and 39NiCrMo3 were used in the tests. For both materials, different specimens were given two surface treatments: simple turning without successive surface treatment, inducing on the surface a moderate tensile residual stress state, and shot peening, inducing high residual compressive stresses. The specimens were submitted to constant-amplitude tension-compression fatigue loading, and the surface residual stresses were measured after 0, 1, 10 cycles and more. Results show that relaxation occurs from the very first cycle; the amount of residual stress relaxation depends on many parameters and on the type of steel. The results are in agreement with data obtained by other researchers.","['S Foletti', 'M Filippini', 'P Davoli', 'E Capello']",10.1243/030932404323042704,http://dx.doi.org/10.1243/030932404323042704,4,2004,Relaxation of residual stresses induced by turning and shot peening on steels,['The Journal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design'],"(['Applied Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Mechanics of Materials', 'Modelling and Simulation'],)",,Science

"Acetylcholinesterase was covalently attached to the inner surface of polyethylene tubing. Initial oxidation generated surface carboxylic groups which, on reaction with thionyl chloride, produced acid chloride groups; these were caused to react with excess ethylenediamine. The amine groups on the surface were linked to glutaraldehyde, and acetylcholinesterase was then attached to the surface. Various kinetic tests showed the catalysis of the hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine iodide to be diffusion controlled. The apparent Michaelis constants were strongly dependent on flow rate and were much larger than the value for the free enzyme. Rate measurements over the temperature range 6–42 °C showed changes in activation energies consistent with diffusion control.","['C F Yam', 'K J Laidler', 'T T Ngo']",10.1139/o79-156,http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/o79-156,0,1979,Kinetics of acetylcholinesterase immobilized on polyethylene tubing,['Canadian Journal of Biochemistry'],"(['General Medicine'],)",,Science

"Aldehyde groups, moderately separated from support surfaces, are proposed as suitable active groups for developing strategies to insolubilize-stabilize enzymes by multipoint covalent attachment to activated preexistent supports. A method for preparation of glyoxyl-Sepharose CL gels, Ag-O-CH2-CHO, with very different surface densities of active groups, up to 17 aldehyde residues per 1000 A2 of gel surface, is presented. These activated gels are very stable, even in moderately alkaline media, e.g., half-life time of these aldehyde groups at pH 10, 25°C, is 12 days. Experiments of insolubilization of the enzyme Penicillin G acylase on these supports indicate that one point amine-aldehyde attachments are fast but quite reversible. However, the binding of the enzyme on the support can be dramatically stabilized by two-point enzyme-support attachment. These qualities, as well as the absence of steric hindrance for the amine-aldehyde chemical reaction, make this activation method very suitable for designing intense, but not distorting, enzyme-support multiinteraction processes.",J M Guisán,10.1016/0141-0229(88)90018-x,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ff275941b154873725439cb20365a8750fce762d,0,1988,Agarose-aldehyde gels as supports for immobilization- stabilization of enzymes,,,['Chemistry'],Science

"Most paratransit agencies use a mix of different types of vehicles ranging from small sedans to large converted vans as a cost-effective way to meet the diverse travel needs and seating requirements of their clients. Currently, decisions on what types of vehicles and how many vehicles to use are mostly made by service managers on an ad hoc basis without much systematic analysis and optimization. The objective of this research is to address the underlying fleet size and mix problem and to develop a practical procedure that can be used to determine the optimal fleet mix for a given application. A real-life example illustrates the relationship between the performance of a paratransit service system and the size of its service vehicles. A heuristic procedure identifies the optimal fleet mix that maximizes the operating efficiency of a service system. A set of recommendations is offered for future research; the most important is the need to incorporate a life-cycle cost framework into the paratransit service planning process.","['Gary Ishkhanov', 'Liping Fu']",10.3141/1884-05,http://dx.doi.org/10.3141/1884-05,1,2004,Fleet Size and Mix Optimization for Paratransit Services,['Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board'],"(['Mechanical Engineering', 'Civil and Structural Engineering'],)",,Structural Engineering

"Due to the imbalance of energy consumption of nodes in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), some local nodes die prematurely, which causes the network partitions and then shortens the lifetime of the network. The phenomenon is called “hot spot” or “energy hole” problem. For this problem, an energy-aware distributed unequal clustering protocol (EADUC) in multihop heterogeneous WSNs is proposed. Compared with the previous protocols, the cluster heads obtained by EADUC can achieve balanced energy, good distribution, and seamless coverage for all the nodes. Moreover, the complexity of time and control message is low. Simulation experiments show that EADUC can prolong the lifetime of the network significantly.","['Xin Gu', 'Qiang Guo', 'Gang Wang', 'Yingying Qi', 'Jiguo Yu']",10.1155/2011/202145,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2011/202145,1,2011,An Energy-Aware Distributed Unequal Clustering Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks,['International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks'],"(['Computer Networks and Communications', 'General Engineering'],)",,Communication

"Future large-scale sensor networks may comprise thousands of wirelessly connected sensor nodes that could provide an unimaginable opportunity to interact with physical phenomena in real time. However, the nodes are typically highly resource-constrained. Since the communication task is a significant power consumer, various attempts have been made to introduce energy-awareness at different levels within the communication stack. Clustering is one such attempt to control energy dissipation for sensor data dissemination in a multihop fashion. The Time-Controlled Clustering Algorithm (TCCA) is proposed to realize a network-wide energy reduction. A realistic energy dissipation model is derived probabilistically to quantify the sensor network's energy consumption using the proposed clustering algorithm. A discrete-event simulator is developed to verify the mathematical model and to further investigate TCCA in other scenarios. The simulator is also extended to include the rest of the communication stack to allow a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed algorithm.","['S Sinnappan', 'S Selvakennedy']",10.1080/15501320601067725,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15501320601067725,2,2007,An Adaptive Data Dissemination Strategy for Wireless Sensor Networks,['International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks'],"(['Computer Networks and Communications', 'General Engineering'],)",,Communication

"Increasing consumer demand for microbiologicallysafer foods, greater convenience,smaller packages, and longer product shelf life is forcing the industry to develop new food-processing,cooking, handling, and packaging strategies. Nonfluid ready-to-eat foods are frequently exposed to postprocess surface contamination, leading to a reduction in shelf life. The food industry has at its disposal a wide range of nonedible polypropylene- and polyethylene-based packaging materials and various biodegradable protein- and polysaccharide-based edible films that can potentially serve as packaging materials. Research on the use of edible films as packaging materials continues because of the potential for these films to enhance food quality, food safety, and product shelf life. Besides acting as a barrier against mass diffusion (moisture, gases, and volatiles), edible films can serve as carriers for a wide range of food additives, including flavoring agents, antioxidants, vitamins, and colorants. When antimicrobial agents such as benzoic acid, sorbic acid, propionic acid, lactic acid, nisin, and lysozyme have been incorporated into edible films, such films retarded surface growth of bacteria, yeasts, and molds on a wide range of products, including meats and cheeses. Various antimicrobial edible films have been developed to minimize growth of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms, including Listeria monocytogenes, which may contaminate the surface of cooked ready-to-eat foods after processing. Here, we review the various types of protein-based (wheat gluten, collagen, corn zein, soy, casein, and whey protein), polysaccharide-based (cellulose, chitosan, alginate, starch, pectin, and dextrin), and lipid-based (waxes, acylglycerols, and fatty acids) edible films and a wide range of antimicrobial agents that have been or could potentially be incorporated into such films during manufacture to enhance the safety and shelf life of ready-to-eat foods.","['Elliot T Ryser', 'Zeynep Ustunol', 'Arzu Cagri']",10.4315/0362-028x-67.4.833,http://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028x-67.4.833,4,2004,Antimicrobial Edible Films and Coatings,['Journal of Food Protection'],"(['Microbiology', 'Food Science'],)",,Entomology Food Science
"The objective of this study was to determine whether chitosan (poly-β-1,4-glucosamine) and hydrolysates of chitosan can be used as novel preservatives in foods. Chitosan was hydrolyzed by using oxidative-reductive degradation, crude papaya latex, and lysozyme. Mild hydrolysis of chitosan resulted in improved microbial inactivation in saline and greater inhibition of growth of several spoilage yeasts in laboratory media, but highly degraded products of chitosan exhibited no antimicrobial activity. In pasteurized apple-elderflower juice stored at 7°C, addition of 0.3 g of chitosan per liter eliminated yeasts entirely for the duration of the experiment (13 days), while the total counts and the lactic acid bacterial counts increased at a slower rate than they increased in the control. Addition of 0.3 or 1.0 g of chitosan per kg had no effect on the microbial flora of houmous, a chickpea dip; in the presence of 5.0 g of chitosan per kg, bacterial growth but not yeast growth was substantially reduced compared with growth in control dip stored at 7°C for 6 days. Improved antimicrobial potency of chitosan hydrolysates like that observed in the saline and laboratory medium experiments was not observed in juice and dip experiments. We concluded that native chitosan has potential for use as a preservative in certain types of food but that the increase in antimicrobial activity that occurs following partial hydrolysis is too small to justify the extra processing involved.","['S Roller', 'J Rhoades']",10.1128/aem.66.1.80-86.2000,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/aem.66.1.80-86.2000,0,2000,Antimicrobial actions of degraded and native chitosan against spoilage organisms in laboratory media and foods,['Applied and Environmental Microbiology'],"(['Ecology', 'Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology', 'Food Science', 'Biotechnology'],)",,Environmental Microbiology and Microbial Ecology

"TerraPy, Magic Wet and Chitosan are soil and plant revitalizers based on natural renewable raw materials. These products stimulate microbial activity in the soil and promote plant growth. Their importance to practical agriculture can be seen in their ability to improve soil health, especially where intensive cultivation has shifted the biological balance in the soil ecosystem to high numbers of plant pathogens. The objective of this study was to investigate the plant beneficial capacities of TerraPy, Magic Wet and Chitosan and to evaluate their effect on bacterial and nematode communities in soils. Tomato seedlings (Lycopersicum esculentum cv. Hellfrucht Frühstamm) were planted into pots containing a sand/soil mixture (1:1, v/v) and were treated with TerraPy, Magic Wet and Chitosan at 200 kg/ha. At 0, 1, 3, 7 and 14 days after inoculation the following soil parameters were evaluated: soil pH, bacterial and fungal population density (cfu/g soil), total number of saprophytic and plant-parasitic nematodes. At the final sampling date tomato shoot and root fresh weight as well as Meloidogyne infestation was recorded. Plant growth was lowest and nematode infestation was highest in the control. Soil bacterial population densities increased within 24 hours after treatment between 4-fold (Magic Wet) and 19-fold (Chitosan). Bacterial richness and diversity were not significantly altered. Dominant bacterial genera were Acinetobacter (41%) and Pseudomonas (22%) for TerraPy, Pseudomonas (30%) and Acinetobacter (13%) for Magic Wet, Acinetobacter (8.9%) and Pseuodomonas (81%) for Chitosan and Bacillus (42%) and Pseudomonas (32%) for the control. Increased microbial activity also was associated with higher numbers of saprophytic nematodes. The results demonstrated the positive effects of natural products in stimulating soil microbial activity and thereby the antagonistic potential in soils leading to a reduction in nematode infestation and improved plant growth.

Levels of acid output, pepsin, protein, lipid peroxides and reduced glutathione and the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were determined in the gastric mucosa of normal and experimental groups of rats. A significant increase in volume and acidity of the gastric juice was observed in the ulcer-induced group of rats. Peptic activity was significantly decreased as compared with that of normal controls. In the rats pre-treated with chitin and chitosan 2% along with feed, the volume and acid output and peptic activity of gastric mucosa were maintained at near normal levels. The level of lipid peroxidation was significantly higher in the ulcerated mucosa when compared with that of normal controls. This was paralleled by a decline in the level of reduced glutathione and in the activity of antioxidant enzymes like GPx, GST, CAT and SOD in the gastric mucosa of ulcer-induced rats. Also, the levels of mucosal proteins and glycoprotein components were significantly depleted in ulcerated mucosa. The pre-treatment with chitin and chitosan was found to exert a significant anti-ulcer effect by preventing all the HCl-ethanol-induced ulcerogenic effects in experimental rats.","['Suseela Mathew', 'P G Viswanathan Nair', 'R Anandan']",10.1211/0022357023079,http://dx.doi.org/10.1211/0022357023079,2,2004,Anti-ulcerogenic effect of chitin and chitosan on mucosal antioxidant defence system in HCl-ethanol-induced ulcer in rats,['Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology'],"(['Pharmaceutical Science', 'Pharmacology'],)",,Science

The optimal pH of this chitosanase was 4.0, and the optimal temperature was between 30 and 40°C.

Among potential inhibitors, the purified chitosanase was only inhibited by Ag            +            . Internal amino acid sequences of the purified chitosanase were obtained. A PCR fragment corresponding to one of these amino acid sequences was then used to screen a genomic library for the entire            choA            gene encoding chitosanase. Sequencing of the            choA            gene revealed an open reading frame encoding a 391-amino-acid protein.

This strain, designated CHB101, produced extracellular chitosan-degrading enzymes in the absence of chitosan. The chitosan-degrading activity in the culture fluid increased when cultures reached the early stationary phase, although the level of activity was low in the exponential growth phase. Two chitosanases, chitosanases I and II, which had molecular weights of 37,000 and 30,000, respectively, were purified from the culture fluid. Chitosanase I exhibited substrate specificity for chitosan that had a low degree of acetylation (10 to 30%), while chitosanase II degraded colloidal chitin and glycol chitin, as well as chitosan that had a degree of acetylation of 30%. Rapid decreases in the viscosities of chitosan solutions suggested that both chitosanases catalyzed an endo type of cleavage reaction; however, chitosan oligomers (molecules smaller than pentamers) were not produced after a prolonged reaction.","['M Okazaki', 'M Kumehara', 'X Y Wang', 'M Nogawa', 'M Shimosaka']",10.1128/aem.61.2.438-442.1995,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/aem.61.2.438-442.1995,0,1995,"Production of Two Chitosanases from a Chitosan-Assimilating Bacterium, Acinetobacter sp.

"Chitosanase was produced by the strain of Streptomyces lividans TK24 bearing the csn gene from Streptomyces sp. N174, and purified by S-Sepharose and Bio-Gel A column chromatography. Partially (25-35%) N-acetylated chitosan was digested by the purified chitosanase, and structures of the products were analysed by NMR spectroscopy. The chitosanase produced heterooligosaccharides consisting of D-GlcN and GlcNAc in addition to glucosamine oligosaccharides [(GlcN)n, n = 1, 2 and 3]. The reducing- and non-reducing-end residues of the heterooligosaccharide products were GlcNAc and GlcN respectively, indicating that the chitosanase can split the GlcNAc-GlcN linkage in addition to that of GlcN-GlcN. Time-dependent 1H-NMR spectra showing hydrolysis of (GlcN)6 by the chitosanase were obtained in order to determine the anomeric form of the reaction products. The chitosanase was found to produce only the alpha-form; therefore it is an inverting enzyme. Separation and quantification of (GlcN)n was achieved by HPLC, and the time course of the reaction catalysed by the chitosanase was studied using (GlcN)n (n = 4, 5 and 6) as the substrate. The chitosanase hydrolysed (GlcN)6 in an endo-splitting manner producing (GlcN)2, (GlcN)3 and (GlcN)4, and did not catalyse transglycosylation. Product distribution was (GlcN)3 &gt;&gt; (GlcN)2 &gt; (GlcN)4. Cleavage to (GlcN)3 + (GlcN)3 predominated over that to (GlcN)2 + (GlcN)4. Time courses showed a decrease in rate of substrate degradation from (GlcN)6 to (GlcN)5 to (GlcN)4. It is most likely that the substrate-binding cleft of the chitosanase can accommodate at least six GlcN residues, and that the cleavage point is located at the midpoint of the binding cleft.","['R Brzezinski', 'I Boucher', 'S Goto', 'Y Honda', 'T Fukamizo']",10.1042/bj3110377,http://dx.doi.org/10.1042/bj3110377,10,1995,Reaction mechanism of chitosanase from Streptomyces sp.

It also seeks to analyze various characteristics of this problem by comparing the solutions generated by the two proposed heuristics with each other and with the lower bound solutions.<jats:title content-type=""-heading"">Design/methodology/approachThe proposed heuristics use a sequential decomposition strategy for generating solutions for this problem.

"Recognition of the importance of the quality of the indoor environment (IEQ) to health, comfort and productivity of building end users has produced increasing numbers of voluntary schemes whose assessment embraces a wide spectrum of environmental attributes. Studies which aim to derive appropriate weighting factors for these attributes through soliciting the perceived importance from experts are abundant. This article reports the findings of a study which, based on face-to-face interviews with 548 end users and 66 building professionals, processed their perceived importance of IEQ using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Attributes included were thermal comfort, air cleanliness, odor and noise associated with the air conditioning system of typical commercial buildings. Correlation analysis of the ranking results of the AHP weights revealed the difference in perceived importance of the attributes according to gender of the respondents. Other factors also found to have influence on the perceived importance of the IEQ were whether the respondents were professionals or other end users and the reason for them working or visiting the buildings and the duration of their stay. These all varied with psychophysical factors such as personal experiences, needs and expectations. Further work is needed to study whether the weighting factors should be derived from the perceptions of experts, end users, or a balance between the two.","['Francis W H Yik', 'Joseph H K Lai']",10.1177/1420326x07080463,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1420326x07080463,8,2007,Perceived Importance of the Quality of the Indoor Environment in Commercial Buildings,['Indoor and Built Environment'],"(['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health'],)",,Science

"A previous adhesive joint analysis that accommodated non-linear adhesive behaviour is extended to model the elasto-plastic response of the adherends. The resulting analysis models the joint as an adherend-adhesive sandwich capable of sustaining any combination of end load conditions, thus enabling a wide variety of adhesive joints to be modelled. The adhesive is assumed to behave as a coupled set of non-linear shear and tension springs, and the adherends as cylindrically bent plates which yield under the action of combined tension and bending. The complete problem is reduced to a set of six non-linear first-order ordinary differential equations which are solved numerically using a finite-difference method. In this way a reasonable assessment of adhesive stresses and strains can be obtained easily, without resorting to the complexity of a two-dimensional finite element solution. A comparison between the results from these two methods has been made and is presented in this paper after the outline of the analysis derivations.","['D A Bigwood', 'A D Crocombe']",10.1243/03093247v274211,http://dx.doi.org/10.1243/03093247v274211,10,1992,Development of a full elasto-plastic adhesive joint design analysis,['The Journal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design'],"(['Applied Mathematics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Mechanics of Materials', 'Modelling and Simulation'],)",,Science

"In this paper the general plane strain problem of adhesively bonded struc tures which consist of two different orthotropic adherends is considered. Assuming that the thicknesses of the adherends are constant and are small in relation to the lateral dimensions of the bonded region, the adherends are treated as plates. Also, assuming that the thickness of the adhesive is small compared to that of the adherends, the thickness variation of the stresses in the adhesive layer is neglected. However, the transverse shear effects in the adherends and the in-plane normal strain in the adhesive are taken into ac count. The problem is reduced to a system of differential equations for the adhesive stresses which is solved in closed form. A single lap joint and a stif fened plate under various loading conditions are considered as examples. To verify the basic trend of the solutions obtained from the plate theory and to give some idea about the validity of the plate assumption itself, a sample pro blem is solved by using the finite element method and by treating the adherends and the adhesive as elastic continua. It is found that the plate theory used in the analysis not only predicts the correct trend for the adhesive stresses but also gives rather surprisingly accurate results.

"A dipstick, competitive immunoassay for rapidly measuring serum oestronesulfate (OS) concentrations in horses was developed to distinguish mares 100or more days pregnant from non-pregnant animals. 6-Ketoestrone6-carboxymethyloxime conjugated to bovine serum albumin (oestrone CMO-BSA) was‘dotted’ 25 mm from the bottom edge of 45 5 mm strips ofpolyester-film-supported cellulose nitrate membrane, pore size 3 m. The stripswere blocked, dried and a 15 5-mm cellulose absorbent sink attached 10 mm fromthe top of each strip. The manufactured dipsticks were stored with desiccantat room temperature until used. A monoclonal antibody recognizing OS wascoated onto uniform, blue-dyed polystyrene microspheres (mean diameter, 0.31m) by adsorption. After blocking, several washes and resuspension bysonication, the antibody-coated microspheres were stored at 4˚C. Theconcentrations of oestrone CMO-BSA dotted onto the dipsticks and OS antibodycoated onto the microspheres were optimized to produce a test that allowedmaximum discrimination between the concentrations of OS found in serum ofmares 100 or more days pregnant (i.e. &gt;30 ng OS mL–1 ) relative to those found in non-pregnant mares(i.e. &lt;10 ng OS mL –1 ). To perform thedipstick test, 30 L of carrier buffer, 10 L of OS antibody-coated microspheresand 10 l of OS standard or serum sample were pipetted into a microwell andmixed. A dipstick was placed in the solution. All the liquid migrated up thedipstick into the absorbent sink within 15–20 min leaving a blue dotwhere the OCMO-BSA had been placed. The intensity of colour of the blue dot,which correlated inversely with the concentration of OS in the standard orserum sample, was assessed visually and by computer image analysis. An OSconcentration less than 5 ng mL –1 produced a deepblue dot, 20 ng/ml a light blue dot and a concentration greater than 50 ngmL –1 a very faint blue dot, or none at all. Serumsamples from 42 non-pregnant mares and 40 mares over 100 days pregnant wereanalysed by the dipstick test. All the serum samples from non-pregnant maresproduced dipsticks with deep blue dots that ranged in intensity from 20 to 38colour intensity units, equivalent to OS concentrations less than 7 ng mL–1 . Sera from all the pregnant mares generateddipsticks with either faint blue dots or none at all (i.e. £=5colour intensity units, equivalent to OS concentrations &gt;40 ng mL–1 ). It is concluded that this novel, rapiddipstick immunoassay offers a practical, alternative means of analysing serumOS concentrations in horses, and enables mares that are 100 or more dayspregnant to be distinguished from those that are not pregnant.","['J Stewart', 'K Henderson']",10.1071/rd00062,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/rd00062,0,2000,A dipstick immunoassay to rapidly measure serum oestrone sulfate concentrations in horses,"['Reproduction, Fertility and Development']","(['Developmental Biology', 'Endocrinology', 'Genetics', 'Molecular Biology', 'Animal Science and Zoology', 'Reproductive Medicine', 'Biotechnology'],)",,Zoology

"Evidence from animals suggests that anti-anthrax protective antigen (PA) immunoglobulin G (IgG) from vaccination with anthrax vaccine adsorbed (AVA) is protective against            Bacillus anthracis            infection. Measurement of anti-PA IgG in human sera can be performed using either enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or fluorescent covalent microsphere immunoassay (ELISA) (R. E. Biagini, D. L. Sammons, J. P. Smith, B. A. MacKenzie, C. A. Striley, V. Semenova, E. Steward-Clark, K. Stamey, A. E. Freeman, C. P. Quinn, and J. E. Snawder, Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 11:50-55, 2004). Both these methods are laboratory based. We describe the development of a rapid lateral-flow immunochromatographic assay (LFIA) test kit for the measurement of anti-PA IgG in serum or whole-blood samples (30-μl samples) using colloidal gold nanoparticles as the detection reagent and an internal control. Using sera from 19 anthrax AVA vaccinees (anti-PA IgG range, 2.4 to 340 μg/ml) and 10 controls and PA-supplemented whole-blood samples, we demonstrated that the LFIA had a sensitivity of approximately 3 μg/ml anti-PA IgG in serum and ∼14 μg/ml anti-PA IgG in whole blood. Preabsorption of sera with PA yielded negative anti-PA LFIAs. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 100% using ELISA-measured anti-PA IgG as the standard. This kit has utility in determining anti-PA antibody reactivity in the sera of individuals vaccinated with AVA or individuals with clinical anthrax.","['C P Quinn', 'S A Robertson', 'J E Snawder', 'C A F Striley', 'B A Mackenzie', 'J P Smith', 'D L Sammons', 'R E Biagini']",10.1128/cvi.13.5.541-546.2006,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/cvi.13.5.541-546.2006,5,2006,"Rapid, Sensitive, and Specific Lateral-Flow Immunochromatographic Device To Measure Anti-Anthrax Protective Antigen Immunoglobulin G in Serum and Whole Blood",['Clinical and Vaccine Immunology'],"(['Microbiology (medical)', 'Clinical Biochemistry', 'Immunology', 'Immunology and Allergy'],)",,Microbiology

"Background: A simple point-of-care method for measuring leukocyte counts in a doctor’s office or emergency room could be of great importance. We developed a protocol for measuring cell count by disrupting the cell membrane and analyzing specific proteins within the cells and used it to analyze proteins from eosinophils and neutrophils.               Methods: Lateral immunochromatographic (ICR) assays have been developed for eosinophil protein X (EPX) and human neutrophil lipocalin (HNL) as measures of the concentration of eosinophils and neutrophils. The correlation between the lateral ICR assays and cell counting of eosinophils and neutrophils was performed manually and with an automated cell counter. RIA assays measuring the same analytes were also compared with the results from cell counting and lateral ICR assays.               Results: The optimized assays showed analytical detection limits below the clinical ranges of 3.36 μg/L and 2.05 μg/L for EPX and HNL, respectively. The recovery was 114.8%–122.8% for EPX and 94.5%–96.9% for HNL. The imprecision was 3%–17% CV for EPX over the whole range and 5%–16% CV for HNL. The correlation coefficients between manually counted cells and lateral ICR assays were 0.9 and 0.83 for EPX and HNL, respectively.               Conclusion: The numbers of eosinophils and neutrophils in small amounts of blood can be estimated in the point-of-care setting by means of fast lateral ICR assays of EPX and HNL.","['Per Venge', 'Ib Mendel-Hartvig', 'Ola Mårtensson', 'Ann Jonsson', 'Gerd Rundström']",10.1373/clinchem.2006.074021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1373/clinchem.2006.074021,2,2007,Lateral Flow Immunoassay Using Europium (III) Chelate Microparticles and Time-Resolved Fluorescence for Eosinophils and Neutrophils in Whole Blood,['Clinical Chemistry'],"(['Biochemistry, medical', 'Clinical Biochemistry'],)",,Biochemistry
"Numerous studies have associated high concentrations of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] with atherosclerosis. We developed a rapid, one-step competitive immunochromatographic assay to measure Lp(a) in plasma. The assay is performed on a nitrocellulose membrane strip and the result is determined by a visual readout of rust-colored colloidal selenium. The assay is based on the principle that Lp(a) in the sample will compete with Lp(a)-coated colloidal selenium for binding to the anti-Lp(a) monoclonal antibody immobilized on the assay strip in the format of four ladder bars. The number of capture bars that appear as a result of the formation of colloidal selenium color is proportional to the concentration of the Lp(a) protein in the samples. The strip assay semiquantitatively measures Lp(a) concentrations ranging from 0 to 180 mg/L of Lp(a) protein in serum, plasma, or fingerstick whole-blood samples. This assay appears very useful for quick identification of individuals with above-normal concentrations of plasma Lp(a) protein (&amp;gt; 70 mg/L), and has potential for monitoring a patient's response to treatment with Lp(a)-lowering drugs.","['J Gordon', 'S Ching', 'C Patel', 'S C Lou']",10.1093/clinchem/39.4.619,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/clinchem/39.4.619,4,1993,One-step competitive immunochromatographic assay for semiquantitative determination of lipoprotein(a) in plasma,['Clinical Chemistry'],"(['Biochemistry, medical', 'Clinical Biochemistry'],)",,Biochemistry

"A newly developed reagent strip assay for the diagnosis of schistosomiasis based on parasite antigen detection in urine of infected individuals was evaluated. The test uses the principle of lateral flow through a nitrocellulose strip of the sample mixed with a colloidal carbon conjugate of a monoclonal antibody specific for            Schistosoma            circulating cathodic antigen (CCA). The strip assay to diagnose a group of highly infected schoolchildren in Mwanza, Tanzania, demonstrated a high sensitivity and association with the intensity of infection as measured both by egg counts, and by circulating anodic antigen and CCA levels determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A specificity of ca. 90% was shown in a group of schistosome-negative schoolchildren from Tarime, Tanzania, an area where schistosomiasis is not endemic. The test is easy to perform and requires no technical equipment or special training. The stability of the strips and the conjugate in the dry format lasts for at least 3 months at ambient temperature in sealed packages, making it suitable for transport and use in areas where schistosomiasis is endemic.

"Hybridomas secreting monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against the Nebraska calf diarrhea strain of bovine rotavirus (BRV) were characterized. Indirect fluorescent-antibody assay, immunodot assay, and immunoprecipitation were used to select hybridomas that produced anti-BRV MAbs. Seven of the MAbs were shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot assay to be reactive with the BRV outer capsid protein, VP7, which has a molecular mass of 37.5 kDa. None of the seven MAbs were reactive with canine rotavirus, bovine coronavirus, or uninfected Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells. Two clones, 8B4 (immunoglobulin G2a [IgG2a]) and 2B11 (IgG1), were found suitable for use in an antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detecting BRV in bovine fecal samples. Both were subtype A specific (G6 subtype) but did not react with all isolates of BRV group A.","['S Kapil', 'J Anderson', 'C J Chard-Bergstrom', 'F Al-Majhdi', 'Y Al-Yousif']",10.1128/cdli.7.2.288-292.2000,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/cdli.7.2.288-292.2000,3,2000,"Development, Characterization, and Diagnostic Applications of Monoclonal Antibodies against Bovine Rotavirus",['Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory Immunology'],"(['Microbiology (medical)', 'Clinical Biochemistry', 'Immunology', 'Immunology and Allergy'],)",,Microbiology
"We studied a dipstick assay for the detection of Leptospira-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies in human serum samples. A high degree of concordance was observed between the results of the dipstick assay and an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Application of the dipstick assay for the detection of acute leptospirosis enabled the accurate identification, early in the disease, of a high proportion of the cases of leptospirosis. Analysis of a second serum sample is recommended, in order to determine seroconversion or increased staining intensity. All serum samples from the patients who were confirmed to be positive for leptospirosis by either a positive microscopic agglutination test or a positive culture but were found to be negative by the dipstick assay were also judged to be negative by the IgM ELISA or revealed borderline titers by the IgM ELISA. Some cross-reactivity was observed for sera from patients with diseases other than leptospirosis, and this should be taken into account in the interpretation of test results. The dipstick assay is easy to perform, can be performed quickly, and requires no electricity or special equipment, and the assay components, a dipstick and a staining reagent, can be stored for a prolonged period without a loss of reactivity, even at elevated temperatures.","['H L Smits', 'C W Van Ingen', 'B W Mol', 'R A Hartskeerl', 'W J Terpstra', 'M G Goris', 'M A Van Der Hoorn', 'G C Gussenhoven']",10.1128/jcm.35.1.92-97.1997,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/jcm.35.1.92-97.1997,0,1997,"LEPTO dipstick, a dipstick assay for detection of Leptospira-specific immunoglobulin M antibodies in human sera.",['Journal of Clinical Microbiology'],"(['Microbiology (medical)'],)",,Microbiology

"Selective catalytic hydrogenation has wide applications in both petrochemical and fine chemical industries, however, it remains challenging when two or multiple functional groups coexist in the substrate. To tackle this challenge, the ""active site isolation"" strategy has been proved effective, and various approaches to the site isolation have been developed. In this review, we have summarized these approaches, including adsorption/grafting of N/S-containing organic molecules on the metal surface, partial covering of active metal surface by metal oxides either via doping or through strong metal-support interaction, confinement of active metal nanoparticles in micro- or mesopores of the supports, formation of bimetallic alloys or intermetallics or core@shell structures with a relatively inert metal (IB and IIB) or nonmetal element (B, C, S, etc.), and construction of single-atom catalysts on reducible oxides or inert metals. Both advantages and disadvantages of each approach toward the site isolation have been discussed for three types of chemoselective hydrogenation reactions, including alkynes/dienes to monoenes, α,β-unsaturated aldehydes/ketones to the unsaturated alcohols, and substituted nitroarenes to the corresponding anilines. The key factors affecting the catalytic activity/selectivity, in particular, the geometric and electronic structure of the active sites, are discussed with the aim to extract fundamental principles for the development of efficient and selective catalysts in hydrogenation as well as other transformations.","['R Schlogl', 'R Wagner', 'W Zhang', 'F Girgsdies', 'I Kasatkin', 'M Friedrich', 'D Rosenthal', 'M Behrens', 'M Armbruster', 'A Ota']",10.1021/acs.chemrev.9b00230,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/04d104f9701099457ff066a8b2b19c614c08e141,0,2011,Intermetallic Compound Pd 2 Ga as a Selective Catalyst for the Semi-Hydrogenation of Acetylene: From Model to High Performance Systems,Chemical reviews,,"['Chemistry', 'Medicine']","History of Science, Technology, and Medicine"

"Model-driven game development (MDGD) is an emerging paradigm where models become first-order elements in game development, maintenance, and evolution. In this article, we present a first approach to 2D platform game prototyping automatization through the use of model-driven engineering (MDE). Platform-independent models (PIM) define the structure and the behavior of the games and a platform-specific model (PSM) describes the game control mapping. Automatic MOFscript transformations from these models generate the software prototype code in C++. As an example, Bubble Bobble has been prototyped in a few hours following the MDGD approach. The resulting code generation represents 93% of the game prototype.","['José Á Carsí Cubel', 'Emanuel Montero Reyno']",10.1145/1541895.1541909,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1541895.1541909,6,2009,Automatic prototyping in model-driven game development,['Computers in Entertainment'],"(['Computer Science Applications'],)",,Science

"In crowdfunding, rewards can make or break success. Yet reward design, choice, and planning still occur based on availability rather than strategy. To address this challenge, this article provides an empirically derived crowd-funding reward toolbox offering guidance in strategically selecting rewards.

"As video game development studios increasingly turn to digital crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter for financing, this article explores the ways in which these processes shape production. It examines in particular the interactions that typically occur between studios and players as part of crowdfunded development, analysing the ways in which these activities inform aspects of video game design. By charting the implications of this burgeoning economic model, the article contributes to scholarship concerning video game production and intervenes within more specific discussions concerning the role of the player within development. The article’s case study, which draws from evidence of production concerning multiple Kickstarter projects, is organised into two sections. The first ascertains the degrees to which Kickstarter users can influence the details of a proposed project during a crowdfunding campaign; the second looks at how developers involve crowdfunding communities within production once funding is secured.",A N Smith,10.1177/1461444814558910,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1461444814558910,11,2014,The backer–developer connection: Exploring crowdfunding’s influence on video game production,['New Media & Society'],"(['Sociology and Political Science', 'Communication'],)",,Political Science

"In a global context of resource scarcity few incentives exist for firms to pursue innovations that provide social externalities if these are not inherently profitable. The purpose of this article is to present an alternative paradigm of societal problem solving entirely premised on second generation innovation processes. Further, a theoretical model of multidimensional, or three dimensional, knowledge creation is offered, together with the notion of a multiplier effect that relates to how knowledge creation can increase exponentially when knowledge is not constrained by proprietary requirements. Second generation innovation is based on probabilistic processes that utilize and maximize economies of scale in pursuit of problem solving. Two processes that contribute to the potential of second generation innovation to solve societal problems are crowdfunding and crowdsourcing. It is argued that the processes required to enable a new paradigm in societal problem solving already exist. A further model is developed based on potential synergies between crowdfunding and crowdsourced research and development. This theoretical model predicts that R&amp;D productivity can be accelerated significantly, and if applied in fields such as proteomics or medical research in general can accelerated increases in research output and therefore benefits to society.",C W Callaghan,10.19030/iber.v13i6.8937,http://dx.doi.org/10.19030/iber.v13i6.8937,0,2014,Crowdfunding to generate crowdsourced R&D: The alternative paradigm of societal problem solving offered by second generation innovation and R&D,['International Business & Economics Research Journal (IBER)'],"([],)",,Science

"Software reliability is defined as the probability of the failure free operation of a software system for a specified period of time in a specified environment. Day by day software applications are growing more complex and with more emphasis on reuse. Component Based Software (CBS) applications have emerged. The focus of this paper is to provide an overview for the state of the art of Component Based Systems reliability estimation. In this paper, we discussed various approaches in terms of their scope, model, methods, technique and validation scheme. This comparison provides insight into determining the direction of future CBS reliability research.","['Arun Sharma', 'Kirti Tyagi']",10.1145/2047414.2047434,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2047414.2047434,11,2011,Reliability of Component Based systems- a Critical Survey,['ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes'],"([],)",,Science

"Service discovery and service aggregation are two crucial issues in the emerging area of service-oriented computing (SOC). We propose a new technique for the discovery of (Web) services that accounts for the need of composing several services to satisfy a client query. The proposed algorithm makes use of OWL-S ontologies, and explicitly returns the sequence of atomic process invocations that the client must perform in order to achieve the desired result. When no full match is possible, the algorithm features a flexible matching by returning partial matches and by suggesting additional inputs that would produce a full match.","['Razvan Popescu', 'Sara Corfini', 'Antonio Brogi']",10.1145/1391949.1391953,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1391949.1391953,9,2008,Semantics-based composition-oriented discovery of Web services,['ACM Transactions on Internet Technology'],"(['Computer Networks and Communications'],)",,Communication

"Sentiment analysis is held to be one of the highly dynamic recent research fields in Natural Language Processing, facilitated by the quickly growing volume of Web opinion data. Most of the approaches in this field are focused on English due to the lack of sentiment resources in other languages such as the Arabic language and its large variety of dialects. In most sentiment analysis applications, good sentiment resources play a critical role. Based on that, in this article, several publicly available sentiment analysis resources for Arabic are introduced. This article introduces the Arabic senti-lexicon, a list of 3880 positive and negative synsets annotated with their part of speech, polarity scores, dialects synsets and inflected forms. This article also presents a Multi-domain Arabic Sentiment Corpus (MASC) with a size of 8860 positive and negative reviews from different domains. In this article, an in-depth study has been conducted on five types of feature sets for exploiting effective features and investigating their effect on performance of Arabic sentiment analysis. The aim is to assess the quality of the developed language resources and to integrate different feature sets and classification algorithms to synthesise a more accurate sentiment analysis method. The Arabic senti-lexicon is used for generating feature vectors. Five well-known machine learning algorithms: naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbours, support vector machines (SVMs), logistic linear regression and neural network are employed as base-classifiers for each of the feature sets. A wide range of comparative experiments on standard Arabic data sets were conducted, discussion is presented and conclusions are drawn. The experimental results show that the Arabic senti-lexicon is a very useful resource for Arabic sentiment analysis. Moreover, results show that classifiers which are trained on feature vectors derived from the corpus using the Arabic sentiment lexicon are more accurate than classifiers trained using the raw corpus.","['Salwani Abdullah', 'Nazlia Omar', 'Adel Al-Shabi', 'Mohammed Albared', 'Tareq Al-Moslmi']",10.1177/0165551516683908,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0165551516683908,2,2017,Arabic senti-lexicon: Constructing publicly available language resources for Arabic sentiment analysis,['Journal of Information Science'],"(['Library and Information Sciences', 'Information Systems'],)",,Information Science

"The growing number of driver assistance systems increases the demand for warnings that are intuitively comprehensible. Particularly in hazardous situations, such as a threatening collision, a driver must understand the warning immediately. For this reason, collision warnings should convey as much information as needed to interpret the situation properly and to prepare preventive actions. The present study investigated whether informing about the object and the location of an imminent crash by a multimodal warning (visual and auditory) leads to shorter reaction times and fewer collisions compared to warning signals which only inform about the object of the crash (auditory icons) or give no additional information (simple tone). Results reveal that multimodal warnings have the potential to produce a significant advantage over unimodal signals as long as their components complement each other in a way that realistically fits the situation at hand.","['Manfred Thüring', 'Nicola Fricke']",10.1177/154193120905302315,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/154193120905302315,10,2009,Complementary Audio-Visual Collision Warnings,['Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting'],"([],)",,Science
"Objective: An evaluation study was conducted to answer the question of which system properties of night vision enhancement systems (NVESs) provide a benefit for drivers without increasing their workload. Background: Different infrared sensor, image processing, and display technologies can be integrated into an NVES to support nighttime driving. Because each of these components has its specific strengths and weaknesses, careful testing is required to determine their best combination. Method: Six prototypical systems were assessed in two steps. First, a heuristic evaluation with experts from ergonomics, perception, and traffic psychology was conducted. It produced a broad overview of possible effects of system properties on driving. Based on these results, an experimental field study with 15 experienced drivers was performed. Criteria used to evaluate the development potential of the six prototypes were the usability dimensions of effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction (International Organization for Standardization, 1998). Results: Results showed that the intelligibility of information, the easiness with which obstacles could be located in the environment, and the position of the display presenting the output of the system were of crucial importance for the usability of the NVES and its acceptance. Conclusion: All relevant requirements are met best by NVESs that are positioned at an unobtrusive location and are equipped with functions for the automatic identification of objects and for event-based warnings. Application: These design recommendations and the presented approach to evaluate the systems can be directly incorporated into the development process of future NVESs.","['Manfred Thüring', 'Josef F Krems', 'Katharina Seifert', 'Diana Rösler', 'Sascha Mahlke']",10.1518/001872007x200148,http://dx.doi.org/10.1518/001872007x200148,6,2007,Evaluation of Six Night Vision Enhancement Systems: Qualitative and Quantitative Support for Intelligent Image Processing,['Human Factors: The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society'],"(['Behavioral Neuroscience', 'Applied Psychology', 'Human Factors and Ergonomics'],)",,Ergonomics

"Data sharing and reuse are crucial to enhance scientific progress and maximize return of investments in science. Although attitudes are increasingly favorable, data reuse remains difficult due to lack of infrastructures, standards, and policies. The FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles aim to provide recommendations to increase data reuse. Because of the broad interpretation of the FAIR principles, maturity indicators are necessary to determine the FAIRness of a dataset. In this work, we propose a reproducible computational workflow to assess data FAIRness in the life sciences. Our implementation follows principles and guidelines recommended by the maturity indicator authoring group and integrates concepts from the literature. In addition, we propose a FAIR balloon plot to summarize and compare dataset FAIRness. We evaluated the feasibility of our method on three real use cases where researchers looked for six datasets to answer their scientific questions. We retrieved information from repositories (ArrayExpress, Gene Expression Omnibus, eNanoMapper, caNanoLab, NanoCommons and ChEMBL), a registry of repositories, and a searchable resource (Google Dataset Search) via application program interfaces (API) wherever possible. With our analysis, we found that the six datasets met the majority of the criteria defined by the maturity indicators, and we showed areas where improvements can easily be reached. We suggest that use of standard schema for metadata and the presence of specific attributes in registries of repositories could increase FAIRness of datasets.","['Egon Willighagen', 'Jeaphianne van Rijn', 'Iseult Lynch', 'Dieter Maier', 'Martine Bakker', 'Joris Quik', 'Laurent Winckers', 'Serena Bonaretti', 'Ammar Ammar']",10.3390/nano10102068,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/10/10/2068/pdf,10,2020,A Semi-Automated Workflow for FAIR Maturity Indicators in the Life Sciences,"['Nanomaterials', 'Nanomaterials']","(['General Materials Science', 'General Chemical Engineering'],)",,Life Sciences

"Climate change may be a major threat to biodiversity in the next 100 years. Although there has been important work on mechanisms of decline in some species, it generally remains unclear which changes in climate actually cause extinctions, and how many species will likely be lost. Here, we identify the specific changes in climate that are associated with the widespread local extinctions that have already occurred. We then use this information to predict the extent of future biodiversity loss and to identify which processes may forestall extinction. We used data from surveys of 538 plant and animal species over time, 44% of which have already had local extinctions at one or more sites. We found that locations with local extinctions had larger and faster changes in hottest yearly temperatures than those without. Surprisingly, sites with local extinctions had significantly smaller changes in mean annual temperatures, despite the widespread use of mean annual temperatures as proxies for overall climate change. Based on their past rates of dispersal, we estimate that 57–70% of these 538 species will not disperse quickly enough to avoid extinction. However, we show that niche shifts appear to be far more important for avoiding extinction than dispersal, although most studies focus only on dispersal. Specifically, considering both dispersal and niche shifts, we project that only 16–30% of these 538 species may go extinct by 2070. Overall, our results help identify the specific climatic changes that cause extinction and the processes that may help species to survive.","['Cristian Román-Palacios', 'John J.

"Background            Virtual screening methods start to be well established as effective approaches to identify hits, candidates and leads for drug discovery research. Among those, structure based virtual screening (SBVS) approaches aim at docking collections of small compounds in the target structure to identify potent compounds. For SBVS, the identification of candidate pockets in protein structures is a key feature, and the recent years have seen increasing interest in developing methods for pocket and cavity detection on protein surfaces.                                Results            Fpocket is an open source pocket detection package based on Voronoi tessellation and alpha spheres built on top of the publicly available package Qhull. The modular source code is organised around a central library of functions, a basis for three main programs: (i) Fpocket, to perform pocket identification, (ii) Tpocket, to organise pocket detection benchmarking on a set of known protein-ligand complexes, and (iii) Dpocket, to collect pocket descriptor values on a set of proteins. Fpocket is written in the C programming language, which makes it a platform well suited for the scientific community willing to develop new scoring functions and extract various pocket descriptors on a large scale level.

"Historically, plants have been sought after as bio-factories for the production of diverse chemical compounds that offer a multitude of possibilities to cure diseases. To combat the current pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), plant-based natural compounds are explored for their potential to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), the cause of COVID-19. The present study is aimed at the investigation of antiviral action of several groups of phytoconstituents against SARS-CoV-2 using a molecular docking approach to inhibit Main Protease (Mpro) (PDB code: 6LU7) and spike (S) glycoprotein receptor binding domain (RBD) to ACE2 (PDB code: 6M0J) of SARS-CoV-2. For binding affinity evaluation, the docking scores were calculated using the Extra Precision (XP) protocol of the Glide docking module of Maestro. CovDock was also used to investigate covalent docking. The OPLS3e force field was used in simulations. The docking score was calculated by preferring the conformation of the ligand that has the lowest binding free energy (best pose). The results are indicative of better potential of solanine, acetoside, and rutin, as Mpro and spike glycoprotein RBD dual inhibitors. Acetoside and curcumin were found to inhibit Mpro covalently. Curcumin also possessed all the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic parameters in the range. Thus, phytochemicals like solanine, acetoside, rutin, and curcumin hold potential to be developed as treatment options against COVID-19.","['Mahesh T. Chhabria', 'Mamta B. Shah', 'Divya M.

"The slime mould            Physarum polycephalum            , an aneural organism, uses information from previous experiences to adjust its behaviour, but the mechanisms by which this is accomplished remain unknown. This article examines the possible role of oscillations in learning and memory in slime moulds. Slime moulds share surprising similarities with the network of synaptic connections in animal brains. First, their topology derives from a network of interconnected, vein-like tubes in which signalling molecules are transported. Second, network motility, which generates slime mould behaviour, is driven by distinct oscillations that organize into spatio-temporal wave patterns. Likewise, neural activity in the brain is organized in a variety of oscillations characterized by different frequencies. Interestingly, the oscillating networks of slime moulds are not precursors of nervous systems but, rather, an alternative architecture. Here, we argue that comparable information-processing operations can be realized on different architectures sharing similar oscillatory properties. After describing learning abilities and oscillatory activities of            P. polycephalum            , we explore the relation between network oscillations and learning, and evaluate the organism's global architecture with respect to information-processing potential. We hypothesize that, as in the brain, modulation of spontaneous oscillations may sustain learning in slime mould.

"This receptor family comprises a group of receptors for the calcitonin/CGRP family of peptides. The calcitonin (CT), amylin (AMY), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and adrenomedullin (AM) receptors (nomenclature as agreed by the NC-IUPHAR Subcommittee on CGRP, AM, AMY, and CT receptors [122, 67]) are generated by the genes CALCR (which codes for the CT receptor) and CALCRL (which codes for the calcitonin receptor-like receptor, CLR, previously known as CRLR). Their function and pharmacology are altered in the presence of RAMPs (receptor activity-modifying proteins),  which are single TM domain proteins of ca. 130 amino acids, identified as a family of three members; RAMP1, RAMP2 and RAMP3. There are splice variants of the CT receptor; these in turn produce variants of the AMY receptor [122], some of which can be potently activated by CGRP. The endogenous agonists are the peptides calcitonin, α-CGRP (formerly known as CGRP-I), β-CGRP (formerly known as CGRP-II), amylin (occasionally called islet-amyloid polypeptide, diabetes-associated polypeptide), adrenomedullin and adrenomedullin 2/intermedin. There are species differences in peptide sequences, particularly for the CTs. CTR-stimulating peptide (CRSP) is another member of the family with selectivity for the CT receptor but it is not expressed in humans [87]. olcegepant (also known as BIBN4096BS, pKi~10.5) and telcagepant (also known as MK0974, pKi~9) are the most selective antagonists available, showing selectivity for CGRP receptors, with a particular preference for those of primate origin. CLR (calcitonin receptor-like receptor) by itself binds no known endogenous ligand, but in the presence of RAMPs it gives receptors for CGRP, adrenomedullin and adrenomedullin 2/intermedin.","['Debbie Hay', 'Christopher S.

"The susceptibility to develop atherosclerosis is increased by intrauterine growth restriction and prenatal exposure to maternal hypercholesterolemia. Here, we studied whether mouse gestational hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis affected fetal development and growth at different stages of gestation. Female LDLR KO mice fed a proatherogenic, high cholesterol (HC) diet for 3 weeks before conception and during pregnancy exhibited a significant increase in non-HDL cholesterol and developed atherosclerosis. At embryonic days 12.5 (E12.5), E15.5, and E18.5, maternal gestational hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis were associated to a 22–24% reduction in male and female fetal weight without alterations in fetal number/litter or morphology nor placental weight or structure. Feeding the HC diet exclusively at the periconceptional period did not alter fetal growth, suggesting that maternal hypercholesterolemia affected fetal weight only after implantation. Vitamin E supplementation (1,000 UI of α-tocopherol/kg) of HC-fed females did not change the mean weight of E18.5 fetuses but reduced the percentage of fetuses exhibiting body weights below the 10th percentile of weight (HC: 90% vs. HC/VitE: 68%). In conclusion, our results showed that maternal gestational hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis in mice were associated to early onset fetal growth restriction and that dietary vitamin E supplementation had a beneficial impact on this condition.","['Attilio Rigotti', 'Gloria Valdés', 'Ludwig Amigo', 'Alonso Quiroz', 'Nicolás Santander', 'Loni Berkowitz', 'Francisca Salas', 'Lilian Mascareño', 'Dolores Busso']",10.1155/2014/280497,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/280497/,9,2014,Early Onset Intrauterine Growth Restriction in a Mouse Model of Gestational Hypercholesterolemia and Atherosclerosis,BioMed Research International,"(['General Immunology and Microbiology', 'General Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology', 'General Medicine'],)",,Anatomy
"Purpose To determine the effects of hypercholesterolemia in pregnant mice on the susceptibility to atherosclerosis in adult life through a new animal modeling approach. Methods Male offspring from apoE−/− mice fed with regular (R) or high (H) cholesterol chow during pregnancy were randomly subjected to regular (Groups R–R and H–R, n = 10) or high cholesterol diet (Groups R–H and H–H, n = 10) for 14 weeks. Plasma lipid profiles were determined in all rats. The abdominal aorta was examined for the severity of atherosclerotic lesions in offspring. Results Lipids significantly increased while high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol/low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol decreased in mothers fed high cholesterol chow after delivery compared with before pregnancy ( p &lt; 0.01). Groups R–H and H–R indicated dyslipidemia and significant atherosclerotic lesions. Group H–H demonstrated the highest lipids, lowest high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol/low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, highest incidence (90%), plaque area to luminal area ratio (0.78 ± 0.02) and intima to media ratio (1.57 ± 0.05).

"The sensory cells of the mammalian organ of Corti assume a precise mosaic arrangement during embryonic development. Manipulation of Wnt signaling can modulate the proliferation of cochlear progenitors, but whether Wnts are responsible for patterning compartments, or specific hair cells within them, is unclear. To address how the precise timing of Wnt signaling impacts patterning across the radial axis, mouse cochlear cultures were initiated at embryonic day 12.5, and subjected to pharmacological treatments at different stages. Early changes in major patterning genes were assessed to understand the mechanisms underlying alterations of compartments. Results show that Wnt activation can promote medial cell fates by regulating medially-expressed Notch genes in a spatiotemporal manner. Wnts can also suppress lateral cell fates by antagonizing Bmp4 expression. Perturbation of the Notch and Bmp pathways revealed which secondary effects were linked to these pathways.

"<p>In the current era of Big Data, existing synthesis tools (e.g. formal meta-analysis) are useful for handling the deluge of data and information. However, there is a need for complementary tools that help to (i) structure data and information, (ii) closely connect evidence to theory and (iii) further develop theory. We present the hierarchy-of-hypotheses (HoH) approach to address these issues. In an HoH, hypotheses are conceptually and visually structured in a hierarchically nested way, where the lower branches can be directly connected to empirical results. Used as an evidence-driven, bottom-up approach, it can (i) show connections between empirical results, even when derived through diverse approaches; and (ii) indicate under which circumstances hypotheses are applicable. Used as a theory-driven, top-down method, it helps uncover mechanistic components of hypotheses. We offer guidance on how to build an HoH, provide examples from population and evolutionary biology and propose terminological clarifications.</p>","['Carlos Aguilar', 'Jostein Starrfelt', 'Tina Heger', 'Isabelle Bartram', 'Raul Rennó Braga', 'Gregory P.

"Asexual reproduction is expected to reduce the adaptive potential to novel or changing environmental conditions, restricting or altering the ecological niche of asexual lineages. Asexual lineages of plants and animals are typically polyploid, an attribute that may influence their genetic variation, plasticity, adaptive potential, and niche breadth. The genus Boechera (Brassicaceae) represents an ideal model to test the relative ecological and biogeographic impacts of reproductive mode and ploidy because it is composed of diploid sexual and both diploid and polyploid asexual (i.e., apomictic) lineages. Here, we demonstrate a strong association between a transcriptionally conserved allele and apomictic seed formation. We then use this allele as a proxy apomixis marker in 1,649 accessions to demonstrate that apomixis is likely to be a common feature across the Boechera phylogeny. Phylogeographic analyses of these data demonstrate (i) species-specific niche differentiation in sexuals, (ii) extensive niche conservation between differing reproductive modes of the same species, (iii) ploidy-specific niche differentiation within and among species, and (iv) occasional niche drift between apomicts and their sexual ancestors. We conclude that ploidy is a substantially stronger and more common driver of niche divergence within and across Boechera species although variation in both traits may not necessarily lead to niche evolution on the species scale.","['Timothy F.

"Overgrazing and climate warming may be important drivers of alpine rangeland degradation in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). In this study, the effects of grazing and experimental warming on the vegetation of cultivated grasslands, alpine steppe and alpine meadows on the QTP were investigated. The three treatments were a control, a warming treatment and a grazing treatment and were replicated three times on each vegetation type. The warming treatment was applied using fibreglass open-top chambers and the grazing treatment was continuous grazing by yaks at a moderately high stocking rate. Both grazing and warming negatively affected vegetation cover. Grazing reduced vegetation height while warming increased vegetation height. Grazing increased but warming reduced plant diversity. Grazing decreased and warming increased the aboveground plant biomass. Grazing increased the preferred forage species in native rangelands (alpine steppe and alpine meadow), while warming increased the preferred forage species in the cultivated grassland. Grazing reduced the vegetation living state (VLS) of all three alpine grasslands by nearly 70%, while warming reduced the VLS of the cultivated grassland and the alpine steppe by 32% and 56%, respectively, and promoted the VLS of the alpine meadow by 20.5%. It was concluded that overgrazing was the main driver of change to the alpine grassland vegetation on the QTP. The findings suggest that grazing regimes should be adapted in order for them to be sustainable in a warmer future.","['Haidi Zhao', 'Xiaoyu Wu', 'Lin Tang', 'Yuanyuan Li', 'Xukun Su', 'Xuexia Wang', 'Shiliang Liu', 'Shikui Dong', 'Qingzhu Gao', 'Yong Zhang']",10.1071/rj14080,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/rj14080,0,2015,"Effects of grazing and climate warming on plant diversity, productivity and living state in the alpine rangelands and cultivated grasslands of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau",The Rangeland Journal,"(['Ecology', 'Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics'],)",,Terrestrial and Aquatic Ecology

"Objective: To evaluate the social isolation index and the speed of new cases of Covid-19 in Brazil.  Methods: Quantitative ecological, documentary, descriptive study using secondary data, comparing the period from March 14 to May 1, 2020, carried out with the 27 Brazilian federative units, characterizing the study population. The data were analyzed through descriptive statistics using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences-SPSS® software, evaluating the correlation between the social isolation index and the number of new cases of Covid-19, using Pearson’s correlation coefficient.  Results: The increase in Covid-19 cases is exponential. There was a significant, negative correlation regarding the social isolation index and the speed of the number of new cases by Pearson's coefficient, which means that as the first one increases, the second one decreases.

"Following the introduction of unprecedented “stay-at-home” national policies, the COVID-19 pandemic recently started declining in Europe. Our research aims were to characterize the changepoint in the flow of the COVID-19 epidemic in each European country and to evaluate the association of the level of social distancing with the observed decline in the national epidemics. Interrupted time series analyses were conducted in 28 European countries. Social distance index was calculated based on Google Community Mobility Reports. Changepoints were estimated by threshold regression, national findings were analyzed by Poisson regression, and the effect of social distancing in mixed effects Poisson regression model. Our findings identified the most probable changepoints in 28 European countries. Before changepoint, incidence of new COVID-19 cases grew by 24% per day on average. From the changepoint, this growth rate was reduced to 0.9%, 0.3% increase, and to 0.7% and 1.7% decrease by increasing social distancing quartiles. The beneficial effect of higher social distance quartiles (i.e., turning the increase into decline) was statistically significant for the fourth quartile. Notably, many countries in lower quartiles also achieved a flat epidemic curve. In these countries, other plausible COVID-19 containment measures could contribute to controlling the first wave of the disease. The association of social distance quartiles with viral spread could also be hindered by local bottlenecks in infection control. Our results allow for moderate optimism related to the gradual lifting of social distance measures in the general population, and call for specific attention to the protection of focal micro-societies enriching high-risk elderly subjects, including nursing homes and chronic care facilities.","['János György Pitter', 'Zoltán Vokó']",10.1007/s11357-020-00205-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11357-020-00205-0,6,2020,The effect of social distance measures on COVID-19 epidemics in Europe: an interrupted time series analysis,GeroScience,"(['Geriatrics and Gerontology', 'Ageing'],)",,Public Health

"Recognized limitations to data in disaster management have led to dozens of initiatives to strengthen data gathering and decision-making during disasters. These initiatives are complicated by fundamental problems of definitions of terms, ambiguity of concepts, lack of standardization in methods of data collection, and inadequate attempts to strengthen the analytic capability of field organizations. Cross-cutting issues in needs assessment, coordination, and evaluation illustrate additional recurring challenges in dealing with evidence in humanitarian assistance. These challenges include lack of agency expertise, dyscoordination at the field level, inappropriate reliance on indicators that measure process rather than outcome, flawed scientific inference, and erosion of the concept of minimum standards.Decision-making in disaster management currently places a premium on expert or eminence-based decisions. By contrast, scientific advances in disaster medicine call for evidence-based decisions whose strength of evidence is established by the methods of data acquisition. At present, disaster relief operations may be data driven, but that does not mean that they are soundly evidence-based.Options for strengthening evidence-based activities include rigorously adhering to evidenced-based interventions, using evidence-based tools to identify new approaches to problems of concern, studying model programs as well as failed ones to identify approaches that deserve replication, and improving standards for evidence of effectiveness in disaster science and services.",David A.

"The development of electronic health records, wearable devices, health applications and Internet of Things (IoT)-empowered smart homes is promoting various applications. It also makes health self-management much more feasible, which can partially mitigate one of the challenges that the current healthcare system is facing. Effective and convenient self-management of health requires the collaborative use of health data and home environment data from different services, devices, and even open data on the Web. Although health data interoperability standards including HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and IoT ontology including Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) have been developed and promoted, it is impossible for all the different categories of services to adopt the same standard in the near future. This study presents a method that applies Semantic Web technologies to integrate the health data and home environment data from heterogeneously built services and devices. We propose a Web Ontology Language (OWL)-based integration ontology that models health data from HL7 FHIR standard implemented services, normal Web services and Web of Things (WoT) services and Linked Data together with home environment data from formal ontology-described WoT services. It works on the resource integration layer of the layered integration architecture. An example use case with a prototype implementation shows that the proposed method successfully integrates the health data and home environment data into a resource graph. The integrated data are annotated with semantics and ontological links, which make them machine-understandable and cross-system reusable.","['Prashant Goswami', 'Cong Peng']",10.3390/s19081747,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/19/8/1747,4,2019,Meaningful Integration of Data from Heterogeneous Health Services and Home Environment Based on Ontology,MDPI,"(['Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Biochemistry', 'Instrumentation', 'Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics', 'Analytical Chemistry'],)",,Environmental Health

"Recently, healthcare services can be delivered effectively to patients anytime and anywhere using e-Health systems. e-Health systems are developed through Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) that involve sensors, mobiles, and web-based applications for the delivery of healthcare services and information. Remote healthcare is an important purpose of the e-Health system. Usually, the eHealth system includes heterogeneous sensors from diverse manufacturers producing data in different formats. Device interoperability and data normalization is a challenging task that needs research attention. Several solutions are proposed in the literature based on manual interpretation through explicit programming. However, programmatically implementing the interpretation of the data sender and data receiver in the e-Health system for the data transmission is counterproductive as modification will be required for each new device added into the system. In this paper, an e-Health system with the Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) is proposed to address the device interoperability issue. In the proposed system, we have used IETF YANG for modeling the semantic e-Health data to represent the information of e-Health sensors. This modeling scheme helps in provisioning semantic interoperability between devices and expressing the sensing data in a user-friendly manner. For this purpose, we have developed an ontology for e-Health data that supports different styles of data formats. The ontology is defined in YANG for provisioning semantic interpretation of sensing data in the system by constructing meta-models of e-Health sensors. The proposed approach assists in the auto-configuration of eHealth sensors and querying the sensor network with semantic interoperability support for the e-Health system.","['Do Hyeun Kim', 'Wenquan Jin']",10.3390/s18020629,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/18/2/629,2,2018,Design and Implementation of e-Health System Based on Semantic Sensor Network Using IETF YANG,"Sensors, MDPI","(['Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Biochemistry', 'Instrumentation', 'Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics', 'Analytical Chemistry'],)",,Environmental Health

"A large number of Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strains have caused major outbreaks and sporadic cases of human illnesses, including mild diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and the life-threatening hemolytic uremic syndrome. These illnesses have been traced to both O157 and non-O157 STEC. In a large number of STEC-associated outbreaks, the infections were attributed to consumption of ground beef or other beef products contaminated with cattle feces. Thus, beef cattle are considered reservoirs of STEC and can pose significant health risks to humans. The global nature of the human food supply suggests that safety concerns with beef will continue and the challenges facing the beef industry will increase at the production and processing levels. To be prepared to address these concerns and challenges, it is critical to assess the role of beef cattle in human STEC infections. In this review, published reports on STEC in beef cattle were evaluated to achieve the following specific objectives: (i) assess the prevalence of STEC in beef cattle, and (ii) determine the potential health risks of STEC strains from beef cattle. The latter objective is critically important because many beef STEC isolates are highly virulent. Global testing of beef cattle feces revealed wide ranges of prevalence rates for O157 STEC (i.e., 0.2 to 27.8%) and non-O157 STEC (i.e., 2.1 to 70.1%). Of the 261 STEC serotypes found in beef cattle, 44 cause hemolytic uremic syndrome and 37 cause other illnesses.","['LAURIE M. BOLLINGER', 'HUSSEIN S.

"A large number of Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strains have caused major outbreaks and sporadic cases of human illnesses, including mild diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and the life-threatening hemolytic uremic syndrome. These illnesses have been traced to both O157 and non-O157 STEC. In a large number of STEC-associated outbreaks, the infections were attributed to consumption of ground beef or other beef products contaminated with cattle feces. Thus, beef cattle are considered reservoirs of STEC and can pose significant health risks to humans. The global nature of the human food supply suggests that safety concerns with beef will continue and the challenges facing the beef industry will increase at the production and processing levels. To be prepared to address these concerns and challenges, it is critical to assess the role of beef cattle in human STEC infections. In this review, published reports on STEC in beef cattle were evaluated to achieve the following specific objectives: (i) assess the prevalence of STEC in beef cattle, and (ii) determine the potential health risks of STEC strains from beef cattle.

"We have developed a whole kidney model of the urine concentrating mechanism and renal autoregulation. The model represents the tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) and myogenic mechanisms, which together affect the resistance of the afferent arteriole and thus glomerular filtration rate. TGF is activated by fluctuations in macula densa [Cl−] and the myogefnic mechanism by changes in hydrostatic pressure. The model was used to investigate the relative contributions of medullary blood flow autoregulation and inhibition of transport in the proximal convoluted tubule to pressure natriuresis in both diuresis and antidiuresis. The model predicts that medullary blood flow autoregulation, which only affects the interstitial solute composition in the model, has negligible influence on the rate of NaCl excretion. However, it exerts a significant effect on urine flow, particularly in the antidiuretic kidney. This suggests that interstitial washout has significant implications for the maintenance of hydration status but little direct bearing on salt excretion, and that medullary blood flow may only play a signaling role for stimulating a pressure-natriuresis response. Inhibited reabsorption in the model proximal convoluted tubule is capable of driving pressure natriuresis when the known actions of vasopressin on the collecting duct epithelium are taken into account.",Robert Moss and Anita T.

"The complexity of the kidney is that mathematical models of renal function depend on the experimental measurements from in-vivo and in-vitro. Earlier models of the nephron use the simple mathematical model that was unable to clearly capture the pressure-diuresis and pressure-natriuresis functionality. In this paper, a mathematical model of nephron has been developed with isoporous glomerulus model for better understanding of the functionality of the nephron for Salt-Sensitive rat(high-salt and low-salt) and Salt-Resistant. Renal blood flow, glomerular filtration, pressure-diuresis and pressure-natriuresis relationships have been explained clearly based on predicted modelling data from the mathematical model of the nephron. The predicted data is compared with the experimental data. The water and sodium excretion are well controlled within the normal limits in the improved isoporous glomerulus nephron model. The predicted data of regulated water and sodium excretion are well fitted with the data collected from experimental studies of the Dahl salt sensitive (low salt and high salt) rat and Dahl salt resistive rat based on calculation of the mean square error for glomerulur filtration, urine output and sodium excretion.",Siva Manohar Reddy Kesu and Hariharan Ramasangu,10.1109/BIBE.2016.59,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7789981,11,2016,Improved Nephron Model for Pressure-Diuresis and Pressure-Natriuresis,2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE),,['Computer Science'],Computational Biology

"Q (query) fever is an infectious zoonotic disease caused by the Gram-negative bacteria Coxiella burnetii. Although the disease has been studied since decades, it still represents a threat due to sporadic outbreaks across farms in Europe. The absence of a central platform for Coxiella typing data management in an important epidemiological gap which is relevant in the case of an outbreak. To fill this gap, we have designed and implemented an online, open-source, and, web-based platform called CoxBase (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" ext-link-type=""uri"" xlink:href=""https://coxbase.q-gaps.de"">https://coxbase.q-gaps.de</jats:ext-link>). This platform includes a database that holds genotyping information of more than 400 Coxiella isolates alongside metadata that annotates them. We have also implemented features for in silico genotyping of completely or minimally assembled Coxiella sequences using five different typing methods, querying existing isolates, visualization of isolate’s geodata via aggregation on a world map and submission of new isolates. We tested our in silico typing method on 50 Coxiella genomes downloaded from the RefSeq database and we successfully genotyped all except for cases where the sequence quality was poor. We identified new spacer sequences using our implementation of the MST in silico typing method, and established adaA gene phenotypes for all 50 genomes as well as their plasmid types.","['Dimitrios Frangoulidis', 'Konrad U.

"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood malignancy, and implementation of risk-adapted therapy has been instrumental in the dramatic improvements in clinical outcomes. A key to risk-adapted therapies includes the identification of genomic features of individual tumors, including chromosome number (for hyper- and hypodiploidy) and gene fusions, notably ETV6-RUNX1, TCF3-PBX1, and BCR-ABL1 in B-cell ALL (B-ALL). RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of large ALL cohorts has expanded the number of recurrent gene fusions recognized as drivers in ALL, and identification of these new entities will contribute to refining ALL risk stratification. We used RNA-seq on 126 ALL patients from our clinical service to test the utility of including RNA-seq in standard-of-care diagnostic pipelines to detect gene rearrangements and IKZF1 deletions. RNA-seq identified 86% of rearrangements detected by standard-of-care diagnostics. KMT2A (MLL) rearrangements, although usually identified, were the most commonly missed by RNA-seq as a result of low expression. RNA-seq identified rearrangements that were not detected by standard-of-care testing in 9 patients. These were found in patients who were not classifiable using standard molecular assessment. We developed an approach to detect the most common IKZF1 deletion from RNA-seq data and validated this using an RQ-PCR assay. We applied an expression classifier to identify Philadelphia chromosome–like B-ALL patients. T-ALL proved a rich source of novel gene fusions, which have clinical implications or provide insights into disease biology. Our experience shows that RNA-seq can be implemented within an individual clinical service to enhance the current molecular diagnostic risk classification of ALL.","['Paul G.

"BackgroundThe major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II characterized by monocytes CD14+ expression of human leukocyte antigen receptors (HLA-DR), is essential for the synapse between innate and adaptive immune response in infectious disease. Its reduced expression is associated with a high risk of secondary infections in septic patients and can be safely corrected by Interferon-y (IFNy) injection. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) induces an alteration of Interferon (IFN) genes expression potentially responsible for the observed low HLA-DR expression in circulating monocytes (mHLA-DR).MethodsWe report a case of one-time INFy injection (100 mcg s.c.) in a superinfected 61-year-old man with COVID-19–associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with monitoring of mHLA-DR expression and clinical tolerance.ObservationsLow mHLA-DR pretreatment expression (26.7%) was observed. IFNy therapy leading to a rapid increase in mHLA-DR expression (83.1%).ConclusionsSevere ARDS in a COVID-19 patient has a deep reduction in mHLA-DR expression concomitantly with secondary infections. The unique IFNy injection was safe and led to a sharp increase in the expression of mHLA-DR. Based on immune and infection monitoring, more cases of severe COVID-19 patients with low mHLA-DR should be treated by IFNy to test the clinical effectiveness.","['Martin Sebastian Winkler', 'Bjoern Tampe', 'Didier Payen', 'Onnen Moerer', 'Julie Schanz', 'Sebastian Uwe Schnitzler', 'Katharina Amschler', 'Clemens Grimm', 'Steffen Dickel']",10.3389/fimmu.2021.645124,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.645124/full,4,2021,Case Report: Interferon-γ Restores Monocytic Human Leukocyte Antigen Receptor (mHLA-DR) in Severe COVID-19 With Acquired Immunosuppression Syndrome,Frontiers in Immunology,"(['Immunology', 'Immunology and Allergy'],)",,Immunology of Infectious Disease
"Emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Zika virus disease, present a major threat to public health1–3. Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty. A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan. Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough. Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.

"Catch crops increase plant species richness in crop rotations, but are most often grown as pure stands. Here, we investigate the impacts of increasing plant diversity in catch crop rotations on rhizosphere C input and microbial utilization. Mustard (Sinapis alba L.) planted as a single cultivar was compared to diversified catch crop mixtures of four (Mix4) or 12 species (Mix12). We traced the C transfer from shoots to roots towards the soil microbial community and the soil respiration in a 13C pulse labelling field experiment. Net CO2-C uptake from the atmosphere increased by two times in mix 4 and more than three times in mix 12. Higher net ecosystem C production was linked to increasing catch crop diversity and increased belowground transfer rates of recently fixed photoassimilates. The higher rhizosphere C input stimulated the growth and activity of the soil microbiome, which was investigated by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analyses. Total microbial biomass increased from 14 to 22 g m−2 as compared to the fallow and was 18 and 8% higher for mix 12 and mix 4 as compared to mustard. In particular, the fungal and actinobacterial communities profited the most from the higher belowground C input and their biomass increased by 3.4 and 1.3 times as compared to the fallow. The residence time of the 13C pulse, traced in the CO2 flux from the soil environment, increased with plant diversity by up to 1.8 times. The results of this study suggest positive impacts of plant diversity on C cycling by higher atmospheric C uptake, higher transport rates towards the rhizosphere, higher microbial incorporation and prolonged residence time in the soil environment. We conclude that diversified catch crop mixtures improve the efficiency of C cycling in cropping systems and provide a promising tool for sustainable soil management.",Norman Gentsch,10.1007/s00374-020-01475-8,"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00374-020-01475-8#:~:text=The%20higher%20rhizosphere%20C%20input,4%20as%20compared%20to%20mustard.",5,2020,Catch crop diversity increases rhizosphere carbon input and soil microbial biomass,Springer Nature,"(['Soil Science', 'Agronomy and Crop Science', 'Microbiology'],)",,Biology/Integrated Biology/ Integrated Biomedical Sciences

"Enemy release is a commonly accepted mechanism to explain plant invasions. Both the diploid Leucanthemum vulgare and the morphologically very similar tetraploid Leucanthemum ircutianum have been introduced into North America. To verify which species is more prevalent in North America we sampled 98 Leucanthemum populations and determined their ploidy level. Although polyploidy has repeatedly been proposed to be associated with increased invasiveness in plants, only two of the populations surveyed in North America were the tetraploid L. ircutianum. We tested the enemy release hypothesis by first comparing 20 populations of L. vulgare and 27 populations of L. ircutianum in their native range in Europe, and then comparing the European L. vulgare populations with 31 L. vulgare populations sampled in North America. Characteristics of the site and associated vegetation, plant performance and invertebrate herbivory were recorded. In Europe, plant height and density of the two species were similar but L. vulgare produced more flower heads than L. ircutianum. Leucanthemum vulgare in North America was 17 % taller, produced twice as many flower heads and grew much denser compared to L. vulgare in Europe. Attack rates by root- and leaf-feeding herbivores on L. vulgare in Europe (34 and 75 %) was comparable to that on L. ircutianum (26 and 71 %) but higher than that on L. vulgare in North America (10 and 3 %). However, herbivore load and leaf damage were low in Europe. Cover and height of the co-occurring vegetation was higher in L. vulgare populations in the native than in the introduced range, suggesting that a shift in plant competition may more easily explain the invasion success of L. vulgare than escape from herbivory.","['Urs Schaffner', 'heinz Müller-Schärer', 'Hariet Hinz', 'Katerina Stajerova', 'Sonja Stutz']",10.1007/s10530-016-1152-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-016-1152-z,4,2016,Can enemy release explain the invasion success of the diploid Leucanthemum vulgare in North America?,"Biological Invasions volume 18, pages 2077–2091 (2016)","(['Ecology', 'Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics'],)",,Motor Control
"The integration of invasive species into native food webs represent multifarious dynamics of ecological and evolutionary processes. We document incorporation ofPrunus serotina(black cherry) into native insect food webs. We find thatP. serotinaharbours a herbivore community less dense but more diverse than its native relative,P. padus(bird cherry), with similar proportions of specialists and generalists. While herbivory onP. padusremained stable over the past century, that onP. serotinagradually doubled. We show thatP. serotinamay have evolved changes in investment in cyanogenic glycosides compared with its native range. In the leaf beetleGonioctena quinquepunctata, recently shifted from nativeSorbus aucupariatoP. serotina, we find divergent host preferences onSorbus- versusPrunus-derived populations, and weak host-specific differentiation among 380 individuals genotyped for 119 SNP loci. We conclude that evolutionary processes may generate a specialized herbivore community on an invasive plant, allowing prognoses of reduced invasiveness over time. On the basis of the results presented here, we would like to caution that manual control might have the adverse effect of a slowing down of processes of adaptation, and a delay in the decline of the invasive character ofP. serotina.","['van de Ven R. et al.', 'Nils Sosef', 'Meulblok M.

"Invasive plant species may benefit from a reduction in herbivory in their introduced range. The reduced herbivory may cause a reallocation of resources from defence to fitness. Here, we evaluated leaf herbivory of an invasive tree species (Ligustrum lucidum Aiton) in its native and novel ranges, and determined the potential changes in leaf traits that may be associated with the patterns of herbivory. We measured forest structure, damage by herbivores and leaf traits in novel and native ranges, and on the basis of the literature, we identified the common natural herbivores of L. lucidum. We also performed an experiment offering leaves from both ranges to a generalist herbivore (Spodoptera frugiperda). L. lucidum was more abundant and experienced significantly less foliar damage in the novel than in the native range, in spite of the occurrence of several natural herbivores. The reduced lignin content and lower lignin : N ratio in novel leaves, together with the higher herbivore preference for leaves of this origin in the laboratory experiment, indicated lower herbivore resistance in novel than in native populations. The reduced damage by herbivores is not the only factor explaining invasion success, but it may be an important cause that enhances the invasiveness of L. lucidum.","['Xiaoming Zou', 'Casertano S.

"Invasive species can displace natives, and thus identifying the traits that make aliens successful is crucial for predicting and preventing biodiversity loss. Pathogens may play an important role in the invasive process, facilitating colonization of their hosts in new continents and islands. According to the Novel Weapon Hypothesis, colonizers may out-compete local native species by bringing with them novel pathogens to which native species are not adapted. In contrast, the Enemy Release Hypothesis suggests that flourishing colonizers are successful because they have left their pathogens behind. To assess the role of avian malaria and related haemosporidian parasites in the global spread of a common invasive bird, we examined the prevalence and genetic diversity of haemosporidian parasites (order Haemosporida, genera Plasmodium and Haemoproteus) infecting house sparrows (Passer domesticus). We sampled house sparrows (N = 1820) from 58 locations on 6 continents. All the samples were tested using PCR-based methods; blood films from the PCR-positive birds were examined microscopically to identify parasite species. The results show that haemosporidian parasites in the house sparrows' native range are replaced by species from local host-generalist parasite fauna in the alien environments of North and South America. Furthermore, sparrows in colonized regions displayed a lower diversity and prevalence of parasite infections. Because the house sparrow lost its native parasites when colonizing the American continents, the release from these natural enemies may have facilitated its invasion in the last two centuries. Our findings therefore reject the Novel Weapon Hypothesis and are concordant with the Enemy Release Hypothesis.",Marzal A. et al.,10.1371/journal.pone.0021905,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/db2cf40fb24aced0de76c7ee973e55c4f265549d,1,2000,"Diversity, loss, and gain of malaria parasites in a globally invasive bird",PloS one,,"['Biology', 'Medicine']",Motor Control

"*Globally, exotic invaders threaten biodiversity and ecosystem function. Studies often report that invading plants are less affected by enemies in their invaded vs home ranges, but few studies have investigated the underlying mechanisms. *Here, we investigated the variation in prevalence, species composition and virulence of soil-borne Pythium pathogens associated with the tree Prunus serotina in its native US and non-native European ranges by culturing, DNA sequencing and controlled pathogenicity trials. *Two controlled pathogenicity experiments showed that Pythium pathogens from the native range caused 38-462% more root rot and 80-583% more seedling mortality, and 19-45% less biomass production than Pythium from the non-native range. DNA sequencing indicated that the most virulent Pythium taxa were sampled only from the native range. The greater virulence of Pythium sampled from the native range therefore corresponded to shifts in species composition across ranges rather than variation within a common Pythium species. *Prunus serotina still encounters Pythium in its non-native range but encounters less virulent taxa. Elucidating patterns of enemy virulence in native and nonnative ranges adds to our understanding of how invasive plants escape disease. Moreover, this strategy may identify resident enemies in the non-native range that could be used to manage invasive plants.","['Clay K.', 'Van der Putten W. H.', 'Tytgat T.', 'Reinhart K.

"Species that are introduced to novel environments can lose their native pathogens and parasites during the process of introduction. The escape from the negative effects associated with these natural enemies is commonly employed as an explanation for the success and expansion of invasive species, which is termed the enemy release hypothesis (ERH). In this study, nested PCR techniques and microscopy were used to determine the prevalence and intensity (respectively) of Plasmodium spp. and Haemoproteus spp. in introduced house sparrows and native urban birds of central Brazil. Generalized linear mixed models were fitted by Laplace approximation considering a binomial error distribution and logit link function. Location and species were considered as random effects and species categorization (native or non-indigenous) as fixed effects. We found that native birds from Brazil presented significantly higher parasite prevalence in accordance with the ERH. We also compared our data with the literature, and found that house sparrows native to Europe exhibited significantly higher parasite prevalence than introduced house sparrows from Brazil, which also supports the ERH. Therefore, it is possible that house sparrows from Brazil might have experienced a parasitic release during the process of introduction, which might also be related to a demographic release (e.g. release from the negative effects of parasites on host population dynamics).","['Kyaw C.

"It is widely accepted that exotic invasive species are one of the most important ecological and economic problems. Reproductive and establishment traits are considered key features of a population expansion process, but few works have studied many of these simultaneously. This work examines how large the differences are in reproductive and establishment traits between two Fabaceae, the exotic invasive, Gleditsia triacanthos and the native, Acacia aroma . Gleditsia is a serious leguminous woody invader in various parts of the world and Acacia is a common native tree of Argentina. Both species have similar dispersal mechanisms and their reproductive phenology overlaps. We chose 17 plants of each species in a continuous forest of the Chaco Serrano Forest of Cordoba, Argentina. In each plant we measured fruit production, fruit removal (exclusion experiments), seed predation (pre- and post-dispersal), seed germination, seed bank (on each focal tree, three sampling periods during the year), and density of seedlings (around focal individuals and randomly in the study site). Gleditsia presented some traits that could favour the invasion process, such as a higher number of seeds per plant, percentage of scarified seed germination and density of seedlings around the focal individuals, than Acacia . On the other hand, Gleditsia presented a higher percentage of seed predation. The seed bank was persistent in both species and no differences were observed in fruit removal. This work highlights the importance of simultaneously studying reproductive and establishment variables involved in the spreading of an exotic invasive species. It also gives important insight into the variables to be considered when planning management strategies. The results are discussed from the perspective of some remarkable hypotheses on invasive species and may contribute to rethinking some aspects of the theory on invasive species.","['Galetto L.', 'Ferreras A.

"We compared community composition, density, and species richness of herbivorous insects on the introduced plant Solidago altissima L. (Asteraceae) and the related native species Solidago virgaurea L. in Japan. We found large differences in community composition on the two Solidago species. Five hemipteran sap feeders were found only on S. altissima. Two of them, the aphid Uroleucon nigrotuberculatum Olive (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and the scale insect Parasaissetia nigra Nietner (Hemiptera: Coccidae), were exotic species, accounting for 62% of the total individuals on S. altissima. These exotic sap feeders mostly determined the difference of community composition on the two plant species. In contrast, the herbivore community on S. virgaurea consisted predominately of five native insects: two lepidopteran leaf chewers and three dipteran leaf miners. Overall species richness did not differ between the plants because the increased species richness of sap feeders was offset by the decreased richness of leaf chewers and leaf miners on S. altissima. The overall density of herbivorous insects was higher on S. altissima than on S. virgaurea, because of the high density of the two exotic sap feeding species on S. altissima. We discuss the importance of analyzing community composition in terms of feeding guilds of insect herbivores for understanding how communities of insect herbivores are organized on introduced plants in novel habitats.","['Ohgushi T.', 'Utsumi S.', 'Ando Y.']",10.1111/j.1570-7458.2010.01017.x,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f7c3065637d902a4228a4884984e49a9ca7750b5,1,2000,Community structure of insect herbivores on introduced and native Solidago plants in Japan,,,['Biology'],Motor Control

"Introduced species are often thought to do well because of an escape from natural enemies. However, once established, they can acquire a modest assemblage of enemies, including parasites, in their new range. Here we quantified prevalence and effects of infection with copepods (family Myicolidae) and pea crabs (Pinnotheres novaezelandiae), in three mussel species, the non‐native Musculista senhousia, and two native mussels, Perna canaliculus and Xenostrobus pulex, at Bucklands Beach, Auckland, New Zealand. Copepod prevalence was highest in X. pulex (17.9%), whereas pea crab prevalence was highest in P. canaliculus (33.6%). Both parasites infected M. senhousia, but at a much lower prevalence. Dry tissue weight was significantly lower in P. canaliculus infected with pea crabs. In addition, we experimentally investigated host species selection by pea crabs. In an experimental apparatus, pea crabs showed a significant attraction to P. canaliculus, but not so for X. pulex or M. senhousia. When the mussels were presented in combination, pea crabs showed a weak attraction for X. pulex. Pea crab attraction to M. senhousia was not significant. It appears that the introduced M. senhousia largely escapes the detrimental effects of infection with either parasite species compared with native mussels occurring in sympatry.","['Poulin R.', 'Inglis G.

"Successful establishment and spread of biological invaders may be promoted by the absence of population-regulating enemies such as pathogens, parasites or predators. This may come about when introduced taxa are missing enemies from their native habitats, or through immunity to enemies within invaded habitats. Here we provide field evidence that trematode parasites are absent in a highly invasive morph of the gastropod Melanoides tuberculata in Lake Malawi, and that the invasive morph is resistant to indigenous trematodes that castrate and induce gigantism in native M. tuberculata. Since helminth infections can strongly influence host population abundances in other host-parasite systems, this enemy release may have provided an advantage to the invasive morph in terms of reproductive capacity and survivorship.","['Todd JA', 'Michel E', 'Genner MJ']",10.1007/s10530-007-9105-1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8b6b1e56eb46cc51ecff8034e483365c0d748cdc,1,2000,Resistance of an invasive gastropod to an indigenous trematode parasite in Lake Malawi,Biological Invasions,,['Biology'],Motor Control
"It is commonly assumed that invasive plants grow more vigorously in their introduced than in their native range, which is then attributed to release from natural enemies or to microevolutionary changes, or both. However, few studies have tested this assumption by comparing the performance of invasive species in their native vs. introduced ranges. Here, we studied abundance, growth, reproduction, and herbivory in 10 native Chinese and 10 invasive German populations of the invasive shrub Buddleja davidii (Scrophulariaceae; butterfly bush). We found strong evidence for increased plant vigour in the introduced range: plants in invasive populations were significantly taller and had thicker stems, larger inflorescences, and heavier seeds than plants in native populations. These differences in plant performance could not be explained by a more benign climate in the introduced range. Since leaf herbivory was substantially reduced in invasive populations, our data rather suggest that escape from natural enemies, associated with increased plant growth and reproduction, contributes to the invasion success of B. davidii in Central Europe.","['Auge H.', 'Hensen I.', 'Ebeling S.

"Nitrogen availability affects both plant growth and the preferences of herbivores. We hypothesized that an interaction between these two factors could affect the early establishment of native and exotic species differently, promoting invasion in natural systems. Taxonomically paired native and invasive species (Acer platanoides, Acer rubrum, Lonicera maackii, Diervilla lonicera, Celastrus orbiculata, Celastrus scandens, Elaeagnus umbellata, Ceanothus americanus, Ampelopsis brevipedunculata, and Vitis riparia) were grown in relatively high-resource (hardwood forests) and low-resource (pine barrens) communities on Long Island, New York, for a period of 3 months. Plants were grown in ambient and nitrogen-enhanced conditions in both communities. Nitrogen additions produced an average 12% initial increase in leaf number of all plants. By the end of the experiment, invasive species outperformed native species in nitrogen-enhanced plots in hardwood forests, where all plants experienced increased damage relative to control plots. Native species experienced higher overall amounts of damage in hardwood forests, losing, on average, 45% more leaves than exotic species, and only native species experienced a decline in growth rates (32% compared with controls). In contrast, in pine barrens, there were no differences in damage and no differences in performance between native and invasive plants. Our results suggest that unequal damage by natural enemies may play a role in determining community composition by shifting the competitive advantage to exotic species in nitrogen-enhanced environments.

"The success of introduced species is frequently explained by their escape from natural enemies in the introduced region.

Not all comparisons of introduced populations to the native population were consistent with expectations of the enemy release hypothesis. Native populations show greater overall parasite prevalence than introduced populations, but the lower prevalence in introduced populations is driven by low prevalence in two populations on oceanic islands (Fiji and Hawaii). When these are excluded, prevalence does not differ significantly. We found a similar number of parasite lineages in native populations compared to all introduced populations. Although there is some evidence that common mynas may have carried parasite lineages from native to introduced locations, and also that introduced populations may have become infected with novel parasite lineages, it may be difficult to differentiate between parasites that are native and introduced, because malarial parasite lineages often do not show regional or host specificity.","['Fleischer R.

"We surveyed naturally occurring leaf herbivory in nine invasive and nine non-invasive exotic plant species sampled in natural areas in Ontario, New York and Massachusetts, and found that invasive plants experienced, on average, 96% less leaf damage than non-invasive species. Invasive plants were also more taxonomically isolated than non-invasive plants, belonging to families with 75% fewer native North American genera. However, the relationship between taxonomic isolation at the family level and herbivory was weak.

"The theory of fluctuating resource availability proposes that the susceptibility of a plant community to invasion by new species (i.e., invasibility) depends upon conditions of intermittent resource enrichment coinciding with the presence of invading propagules. We compared the response of a rapidly invading forb (Hieracium pilosella L.) between different experimental treatments in a short tussock grassland in New Zealand, over 6–12 years, to determine whether the theory explains differences in invasibility. The theory predicts that environments subject to periodic resource enrichment will be more invasible than those with more stable resource-supply rates. In our study, H. pilosella did not increase more rapidly in treatments subject to periodic resource pulses (fertiliser and water) than in those with more stable resource supplies. Also contrary to the predictions of the theory, the rate of invasion of H. pilosella did not increase following an increase in the rate of supply of water or nutrient resources, or following treatments that temporarily reduced resource uptake in the community, including grazing. H. pilosella did not increase immediately following abrupt increases in water and nutrient supply and removal of the dominant grass species with herbicide, as predicted by the theory, although temporary increases in resident exotic guilds indicated that the intensity of competition for resources was reduced. Neither H. pilosella nor resident exotic guilds showed increased cover growth rates following resumed grazing. The rate of invasion by H. pilosella was not correlated with species richness, a result consistent with one of the predictions of the theory. Therefore, short-lived events that temporarily reduced or suspended competition did not appear to determine the invasion success of this particular species in this region. In New Zealand’s perennial short tussock grasslands, the characteristics of the resident plant community may be more critical than resource fluctuations in determining invasion success of H. pilosella. Invasion of H. pilosella may be most successfully controlled here by promoting a successional physiognomic shift to a taller, shrub-and-tussock-dominated canopy that competitively excludes low-growing forbs.","['Lee WG', 'Wilson JB', 'Walker S']",10.1007/s10530-004-8976-7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b34f0172f3ffca11020dd1698c5c320388558b18,1,2000,Does fluctuating resource availability increase invasibility?

"Understanding the mechanisms that facilitate establishment of non-indigenous species is imperative for devising techniques to reduce invasion rates. Passively dispersing non-indigenous organisms, including zooplankton, seemingly invade constructed waters (e.g., ornamental ponds, dams and reservoirs) at faster rates than natural lakes. A common attribute of these invaded water bodies is their relatively young age, leading to the assertion that low biotic resistance may lead to their higher vulnerability. Our aim was to determine if seeding of young water bodies with sediments containing diapausing stages of native zooplankton could accelerate community development, leading to greater biotic resistance to the establishment of new species. Twenty outdoor tanks were filled with water (1,400 L) and nutrients added to attain eutrophic conditions. Ten treatment tanks had sediments added, sourced from local water bodies. In the remaining ten, sediments were autoclaved, and received zooplankton via natural dispersal only. In an initial 12 month monitoring period, species richness increased at a greater rate in the treatment tanks (at 12 months average standing richness per tank = 3.8, accumulated richness = 8.2) than control tanks (2.6 and 5.0, P < 0.05). Treatment tanks developed assemblages with greater proportions of species adapted to pelagic conditions, such as planktonic cladocerans and copepods, while control tanks generally comprised of smaller, littoral dwelling, rotifers. Analysis of similarities indicated community composition differed between the control and treatment groups at 12 months (P < 0.01). Two copepod, four rotifer and one cladoceran species were intentionally added to tanks at 12 months. In the 3 month post-introduction period, five of these species established populations in the control tanks, while only two species established in the treatment tanks. The calanoid copepod Skistodiaptomus pallidus, for example, a non-indigenous species confined to constructed waters in New Zealand, established exclusively in tanks where native calanoid copepod species were absent (primarily control tanks). Our study suggests that biotic resistance could play an important role in reducing the establishment rate of non-indigenous zooplankton. It also provides evidence that seeding constructed water bodies with sediments containing diapausing eggs of native species may provide an effective management tool to reduce establishment rates of non-indigenous zooplankton.","['Duggan I', 'Taylor C']",10.1007/s10530-011-0063-2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2687c8d8f56d6f2045e52d3e89cb94d8f164a33e,1,2000,Can biotic resistance be utilized to reduce establishment rates of non-indigenous species in constructed waters?,Biological Invasions,,['Biology'],Motor Control

"We examined the relationship between native and alien plant species richness, cover, and estimated biomass at multiple spatial scales. The large dataset included 7051 1-m subplots, 1443 10-m subplots, and 727 100-m subplots, nested in 727 1000-m plots in 37 natural vegetation types in seven states in the central United States. We found that native and alien species richness (averaged across the vegetation types) increased significantly with plot area. Furthermore, the relationship between native and alien species richness became increasingly positive and significant from the plant neighbourhood scale (1-m) to the 10-m, 100-m, and the 1000-m scale where over 80% of the vegetation types had positive slopes between native and alien species richness. Both native and alien plant species may be responding to increased resource availability and/or habitat heterogeneity with increased area. We found significant positive relationships between the coefficient of variation of native cover in 1-m subplots in a vegetation type (i.e. a measure of habitat heterogeneity), and both the relative cover and relative biomass of alien plant species. At the 1000-m scale, we did find weak negative relationships between native species richness and the cover, biomass, and relative cover of alien plant species. However, we found very strong positive relationships between alien species richness and the cover, relative cover, and relative biomass of alien species at regional scales. These results, along with many other field studies in natural ecosystems, show that the dominant general pattern in invasion ecology at multiple spatial scales is one of “biotic acceptance” where natural ecosystems tend to accommodate the establishment and coexistence of introduced species despite the presence and abundance of native species.

"At large spatial scales, exotic and native plant diversity exhibit a strong positive relationship. This may occur because exotic and native species respond similarly to processes that influence diversity over large geographical areas. To test this hypothesis, we compared exotic and native species-area relationships within six North American ecoregions. We predicted and found that within ecoregions the ratio of exotic to native species richness remains constant with increasing area. Furthermore, we predicted that areas with more native species than predicted by the species-area relationship would have proportionally more exotics as well. We did find that these exotic and native deviations were highly correlated, but areas that were good (or bad) for native plants were even better (or worse) for exotics.

"The degree to which invasive species drive or respond to environmental change has important implications for conservation and invasion management. Often characterized as a driver of change in North American woodlands, the invasive herb garlic mustard may instead respond to declines in native plant cover and diversity. We tested effects of native herb cover, richness, and light availability on garlic mustard invasion in a Minnesota oak woodland. We planted 50 garlic mustard seeds into plots previously planted with 0 to 10 native herb species. We measured garlic mustard seedling establishment, survival to rosette and adult stages, and average (per plant) and total (per plot) biomass and silique production. With the use of structural equation models, we analyzed direct, indirect, and net effects of native cover, richness, and light on successive garlic mustard life stages. Native plant cover had a significant negative effect on all life stages. Species richness had a significant positive effect on native cover, resulting in indirect negative effects on all garlic mustard stages, and net negative effects on adult numbers, total biomass, and silique production. Light had a strong negative effect on garlic mustard seedling establishment and a positive effect on native herb cover, resulting in significant negative net effects on garlic mustard rosette and adult numbers. However, light's net effect on total garlic mustard biomass and silique production was positive; reproductive output was high even in low-light/high-cover conditions. Combined effects of cover, richness, and light suggest that native herbs provide biotic resistance to invasion by responding to increased light availability and suppressing garlic mustard responses, although this resistance may be overwhelmed by high propagule pressure. Garlic mustard invasion may occur, in part, in response to native plant decline. Restoring native herbs and controlling garlic mustard seed production may effectively reduce garlic mustard spread and restore woodland diversity.","['Jordan N', 'Larson D', 'Phillips-Mao L']",10.1614/ipsm-d-13-00003.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1614/ipsm-d-13-00003.1,1,2000,Effects of Native Herbs and Light on Garlic Mustard (Alliaria petiolata) Invasion,['Invasive Plant Science and Management'],"(['Plant Science'],)",,Motor Control

"There is often an inverse relationship between the diversity of a plant community and the invasibility of that community by non-native plants. Native herbivores that colonize novel plants may contribute to diversity–invasibility relationships by limiting the relative success of non-native plants. Here, we show that, in large collections of non-native oak trees at sites across the USA, non-native oaks introduced to regions with greater oak species richness accumulated greater leaf damage than in regions with low oak richness. Underlying this trend was the ability of herbivores to exploit non-native plants that were close relatives to their native host. In diverse oak communities, non-native trees were on average more closely related to native trees and received greater leaf damage than those in depauperate oak communities. Because insect herbivores colonize non-native plants that are similar to their native hosts, in communities with greater native plant diversity, non-natives experience greater herbivory.","['Hipp A', 'Pearse I']",10.1098/rspb.2014.1841,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aad037d7f804bdf485508c09ced1be7968031991,1,2000,Native plant diversity increases herbivory to non-natives,Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,,"['Biology', 'Medicine']",Motor Control

"Phalaris arundinacea L. (reed canary grass) is a major invader of wetlands in temperate North America; it creates monotypic stands and displaces native vegetation. In this study, the effect of plant canopies on the establishment of P. arundinacea from seed in a fen, fen-like mesocosms, and a fen restoration site was assessed. In Wingra Fen, canopies that were more resistant to P. arundinacea establishment had more species (eight or nine versus four to six species) and higher cover of Aster firmus. In mesocosms planted with Glyceria striata plus 1, 6, or 15 native species, all canopies closed rapidly and prevented P. arundinacea establishment from seed, regardless of the density of the matrix species or the number of added species. Only after gaps were created in the canopy was P. arundinacea able to establish seedlings; then, the 15-species treatment reduced establishment to 48% of that for single-species canopies. A similar experiment in the restoration site produced less cover of native plants, and P. arundinacea recruited more readily. Results suggest that, where conditions are favorable for native plant growth, even species-poor canopies can inhibit P. arundinacea establishment from seed, but when disturbances create gaps, species-rich canopies confer greater resistance to invasion.Key words: diversity, establishment, fen, invasion resistance, species richness, wetlands.","['Zedler JB', 'Lindig-Cisneros R']",10.1139/b02-042,http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b02-042,1,2000,"Phalaris arundinacea seedling establishment: effects of canopy complexity in fen, mesocosm, and restoration experiments",['Canadian Journal of Botany'],"(['Plant Science'],)",,Motor Control

"Species-rich plant communities may be more resistant to invasive herbivores because of reduced host-plant accessibility and increased natural enemy diversity and abundance. We tested these hypotheses in Corsica, a Mediterranean island recently invaded by the maritime pine bast scale, Matsucoccus feytaudi Duc., which causes widespread tree mortality in Pinus pinaster Ait. The endemic Matsucoccus pini Green infests Corsican pine, Pinus nigra laricio Poiret, where it is controlled by the native predatory bug Elatophilus nigricornis Zetterstedt. As revealed by kairomone trapping, E. nigricornis was most abundant in pure Corsican pine in areas not yet colonized by M. feytaudi, and in pure maritime pine its density decreased with the distance from the nearest Corsican pine forest. The abundance of M. feytaudi was compared in five pairs of pure maritime pine and mixed maritime and Corsican pine stands. It was consistently higher in pure than in mixed maritime pine stands, whereas E. nigricornis showed the opposite pattern, and relative differences were correlated with the proportion of Corsican pine in the mixture. The predation by E. nigricornis was manipulated in pure maritime pine stands using synthetic attractants of the predator. Matsucoccus feytaudi density was significantly reduced in maritime pines baited with kairomone dispensers.","['Brockerhoff EG', 'Samalens JC', 'Gaulier A', 'Vetillard F', 'Menassieu P', 'Jactel H']",10.1139/x05-251,http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x05-251,1,2000,"Tree species diversity reduces the invasibility of maritime pine stands by the bast scale, Matsucoccus feytaudi (Homoptera: Margarodidae)",['Canadian Journal of Forest Research'],"(['Ecology', 'Forestry', 'Global and Planetary Change'],)",,Motor Control

"Both human-related and natural factors can affect the establishment and distribution of exotic species. Understanding the relative role of the different factors has important scientific and applied implications. Here, we examined the relative effect of human-related and natural factors in determining the richness of exotic bird species established across Europe. Using hierarchical partitioning, which controls for covariation among factors, we show that the most important factor is the human-related community-level propagule pressure (the number of exotic species introduced), which is often not included in invasion studies due to the lack of information for this early stage in the invasion process. Another, though less important, factor was the human footprint (an index that includes human population size, land use and infrastructure). Biotic and abiotic factors of the environment were of minor importance in shaping the number of established birds when tested at a European extent using 50×50 km            2            grid squares. We provide, to our knowledge, the first map of the distribution of exotic bird richness in Europe. The richest hotspot of established exotic birds is located in southeastern England, followed by areas in Belgium and The Netherlands. Community-level propagule pressure remains the major factor shaping the distribution of exotic birds also when tested for the UK separately. Thus, studies examining the patterns of establishment should aim at collecting the crucial and hard-to-find information on community-level propagule pressure or develop reliable surrogates for estimating this factor. Allowing future introductions of exotic birds into Europe should be reconsidered carefully, as the number of introduced species is basically the main factor that determines the number established.","['Kark S.', 'Shirley S.', 'Chiron F.']",10.1098/rspb.2008.0994,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2008.0994,1,2000,Human-related processes drive the richness of exotic birds in Europe,['Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences'],"(['General Agricultural and Biological Sciences', 'General Environmental Science', 'General Immunology and Microbiology', 'General Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology', 'General Medicine'],)",,Motor Control

"Species invasion is one of the leading mechanisms of global environmental change, particularly in freshwater ecosystems. We used the Food and Agriculture Organization's Database of Invasive Aquatic Species to study invasion rates and to analyze invasion pathways within Europe. Of the 123 aquatic species introduced into six contrasting European countries, the average percentage established is 63%, well above the 5%20% suggested by Williamson's ""tens"" rule. The introduction and establishment transitions are independent of each other, and species that became widely established did so because their introduction was attempted in many countries, not because of a better establishment capability. The most frequently introduced aquatic species in Europe are freshwater fishes. We describe clear introduction pathways of aquatic species into Europe and three types of country are observed: ""recipient and donor"" (large, midlatitude European countries, such as France, the United Kingdom, and Germany, that give and receive the most introductions), ""recipient"" (most countries, but particularly southern countries, which give few species but receive many), and ""neither recipient nor donor"" (only two countries). A path analysis showed that the numbers of species given and received are mediated by the size (area) of the country and population density, but not gross domestic product per capita.","['Feo C.', 'Coenders G.', 'Zamora L.', 'Pou-Rovira Q.', 'Alcaraz C.', 'García-Berthou E.']",10.1139/f05-017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f05-017,1,2000,Introduction pathways and establishment rates of invasive aquatic species in Europe,['Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences'],"(['Aquatic Science', 'Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics'],)",,Motor Control

"Scolytinae species are among the most damaging forest pests, and many of them are invasive. Over 1500 Scolytinae interceptions were recorded at New Zealand's borders between 1950 and 2000. Among the 103 species were Dendroctonus ponderosae, Ips typographus, and other high-risk species, but actual arrivals probably included many more species. Interceptions were primarily associated with dunnage, casewood (crating), and sawn timber, and originated from 59 countries, mainly from Europe, Australasia, northern Asia, and North America. New Zealand and United States interception data were highly correlated, and 7 of the 10 most intercepted species were shared. Interception frequency and establishment in New Zealand were not clearly related. By combining New Zealand and United States interceptions of true bark beetles we obtained data on species found in shipments from around the world. Logistic regression analysis showed that frequently intercepted species were about four times as likely as rarely intercepted species to be established somewhere. Interception records of wood and bark borers are valuable for the prediction of invaders and for our general understanding of invasions. The use of alternatives to solid wood packaging, such as processed wood, should be encouraged to reduce the spread of invasive wood and bark borers.","['Knížek M.', 'Kimberley M.', 'Bain J.', 'Brockerhoff E.G.']",10.1139/x05-250,http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x05-250,1,2000,Interception frequency of exotic bark and ambrosia beetles (Coleoptera: Scolytinae) and relationship with establishment in New Zealand and worldwide,['Canadian Journal of Forest Research'],"(['Ecology', 'Forestry', 'Global and Planetary Change'],)",,Motor Control

"We conducted comparisons for exotic mammal species introduced to New Zealand (28 successful, 4 failed), Australia (24, 17) and Britain (15, 16). Modelling of variables associated with establishment success was constrained by small sample sizes and phylogenetic dependence, so our results should be interpreted with caution. Successful species were subject to more release events, had higher climate matches between their overseas geographic range and their country of introduction, had larger overseas geographic range sizes and were more likely to have established an exotic population elsewhere than was the case for failed species. Of the mammals introduced to New Zealand, successful species also had larger areas of suitable habitat than did failed species.

"Ponto-Caspian gammarids have invaded European waters, affecting local communities by predation and competition. Their ranges and dispersal rates vary across Europe, which may result from their interspecific interactions, accelerating or reducing migrations. We checked this hypothesis by testing interference competition among co-occurring invaders: Dikerogammarus villosus, D. haemobaphes and Pontogammarus robustoides. We used 140-cm long tanks (gravel substratum), divided into seven compartments. We introduced 25 “residents” into the outermost compartment, separated with a barrier. After 1 h, we introduced 25 “intruders”. After the next 1 h, we removed the barrier and the gammarids dispersed in the tank. After 4 or 20 h, we counted the gammarids in the compartments. We tested all pairwise species combinations and single-species controls. Dikerogammarus villosus displaced other species (P. robustoides only after 4 h) and reduced its own motility after 20 h in their presence. Pontogammarus robustoides stimulated the short-time migrations of D. villosus intruders and of D. haemobaphes. As P. robustoides migrated spontaneously much more than Dikerogammarus spp., its impact decreased after longer time. Dikerogammarus haemobaphes stimulated the short-time movement of P. robustoides intruders but reduced the long-time relocation of this species. In general, gammarid dispersal increased in the presence of stronger competitors (D. villosus and P. robustoides, especially residents) and decreased in response to weaker competitors (D. haemobaphes). Thus, competitive interactions may affect dispersal of invasive gammarids and contribute to the fastest spread of the weakest competitor, D. haemobaphes observed in the field, whereas the strongest species, D. villosus was the latest newcomer in many novel areas.",Kobak et al,10.1007/s10530-016-1140-3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/47807005ab5c84d6a19af6a4280b584fa297e25b,1,2000,Conquerors or exiles?

"Guinea-grass ( Megathyrsus maximus (Jacq.) B.K. Simon & S.W.L. Jacobs – Poaceae) is an invasive C4 grass that known to slow ecological succession in restoration sites. This study aimed to evaluate the responses of the woody species and M. maximus itself to manual removal in a 20-year-old reforestation site. Forty-five 5 × 5-m plots were established in 2008 and evaluated until 2012. The plots were divided into three treatments: control (CON), manual removal for one year (MR1), and manual removal for two years (MR2). All individuals of woody species >10 cm were sampled. Canopy cover, grass cover, and the number of seedlings of M. maximus were also recorded. After the first weeding, M. maximus seedlings were manually uprooted every four months, for a total of three times in MR1 (2008–2009) and six times in MR2 (2008–2010). After the manual removal was stopped, the seedlings of M. maximus were counted and were allowed to grow in order to assess its reestablishment potential. The number of new grass seedlings decreased drastically after the first year with repeated removals and did not differ between removal treatments at any time, even after removals halted, indicating that one year of removal was sufficient to displace the grass. With the exclusion of Guinea-grass, an increase in the abundance and richness of other exotic species was observed until the second year. However, the increase in canopy cover during the four years likely benefited native woody species and impaired M. maximus and other exotics. In addition, after four years, although the woody species richness did not differ between the three treatments, the total abundance and pioneer species richness were higher in both removal treatments. These findings suggest that the grass slows ecological succession. However, both the increase in canopy cover and decrease in grass cover indicate that, in the absence of fire, native vegetation will suppress Guinea-grass. Furthermore, grass removal from the understory of early secondary forests and reforestations can be used to accelerate succession, reducing both fire risk and failures of ecological restoration initiatives.","['Torezan', 'Mantoani']",10.1016/J.FORECO.2015.10.004,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7a1c051fec86dcc9977f27d6a02e51b5c08d166f,1,2000,Regeneration response of Brazilian atlantic Forest woody species to four yers of Megathyrsus maximus removal,,,['Biology'],Motor Control

Experimental mesocosms containing single species litter or a mixture of honeysuckle and one of two native tree species litter were established at South Farms and Trelease Woods study sites in Urbana, IL, and examined for their effect on 1) oviposition site selection by the three mosquito species, and 2) adult production and body size of Oc. triseriatus and Oc. japonicus. There were no significant effects of study site and leaf treatment on Oc. japonicus and Oc. triseriatus oviposition preference and adult production. In contrast, significantly more Cx. restuans eggs rafts were collected at South Farms relative to Trelease Woods and in honeysuckle litter relative to native tree species litter. Significantly larger adult females of Oc. japonicus and Oc. triseriatus were collected at South Farms relative to Trelease Woods and in honeysuckle litter relative to native tree species litter. Combining honeysuckle litter with native tree species litter had additive effects on Cx. restuans oviposition preference and Oc. japonicus and Oc. triseriatus body size, with the exception of honeysuckle and northern red oak litter combination, which had antagonistic effects on Oc. triseriatus body size.

"SUMMARY 1. When an invasive predator encounters native and invasive prey, two scenarios are possible: thepredator may beneﬁt from the presence of na€ive native prey or choose prey from its region of origin,reﬂecting their common evolutionary history.2. To determine interactions between an invasive predator and native and invasive prey, we usedthe Ponto-Caspian racer goby Babka gymnotrachelus as predator and gammarids as prey: nativeGammarus fossarum and Ponto-Caspian Dikerogammarus villosus and Pontogammarus robustoides. We hy-pothesised that prey origin would affect ﬁsh preferences and growth rate and conducted a series oflaboratory experiments on ﬁsh predation and growth and estimated proﬁtability of prey of differentorigin.3. The goby preferred native prey to the Ponto-Caspian gammarids, irrespective of prey motility, thepresence of shelters or waterborne chemical cues. Moreover, ﬁsh grew better when fed native prey.4. Thus, we suggest that ﬁsh selectivity was based on the assessment of prey quality during directcontact with gammarids. A diet consisting of Ponto-Caspian gammarids did not facilitate an invaderoriginating from the same region, which beneﬁted more from the presence of a local prey species.5. Ponto-Caspian gammarids and gobies are successful invaders in inland waters, usually main riv-ers. The gobies, in contrast to the invasive gammarids, enter smaller tributaries that serve as refugiafor native gammarids. We show that the gobies may beneﬁt from the presence of native prey speciesin such locations.Keywords: Babka gymnotrachelus, invasional meltdown, invasive species, predator–prey relationship, preyquality",Blonska et al,10.1111/FWB.12647,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1dab500b3e19b0fb5356072ee196e93cb610a96d,1,2000,Feeding preferences of na invasive Ponto-Caspian goby for native and non-native gammarid prey,,,['Biology'],Motor Control

"The spread of nonnative species over the last century has profoundly altered freshwater ecosystems, resulting in novel species assemblages. Interactions between nonnative species may alter their impacts on native species, yet few studies have addressed multispecies interactions. The spread of whirling disease, caused by the nonnative parasite Myxobolus cerebralis, has generated declines in wild trout populations across western North America. Westslope Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi in the northern Rocky Mountains are threatened by hybridization with introduced Rainbow Trout O. mykiss. Rainbow Trout are more susceptible to whirling disease than Cutthroat Trout and may be more vulnerable due to differences in spawning location.

"Biological invasions cause organisms to face new predators, but also supply new anti-predator shelters provided by alien ecosystem engineers. We checked the level of anti-predator protection provided to three gammarid species by an invasive Ponto-Caspian zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha, known for its habitat modification abilities. We used gammarids differing in their origin and level of association with mussels: Ponto-Caspian aliens Dikerogammarus villosus (commonly occurring in mussel beds) and Pontogammarus robustoides (not associated with mussels), as well as native European Gammarus fossarum (not co-occurring with dreissenids). The gammarids were exposed to predation of two fish species: the racer goby Babka gymnotrachelus (Ponto-Caspian) and Amur sleeper Perccottus glenii (Eastern Asian). This set of organisms allowed us to check whether the origin and level of association with mussels of both prey and predators affect the ability of gammarids to utilize zebra mussel beds as shelters. We tested gammarid survival in the presence of fish and one of five substrata: sand, macrophytes, stones, living mussels and empty mussel valves. D. villosus survived better than its congeners on all substrata, and its survival was highest in living dreissenids. The survival of the other gammarids was similar on all substrata. Both fish species exhibited similar predation efficiency. Thus, D. villosus, whose affinity to dreissenids has already been established, utilizes them as protection from fish predators, including allopatric predators, more efficiently than other amphipods. Therefore, the presence of dreissenids in areas invaded by D. villosus is likely to help the invader establish itself in a new place.",Kobak et al,10.1007/s10452-014-9492-1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01205e9ec9b9b17c89b198f497cb8121d6abc8f1,1,2000,Effectiveness of zebra mussels to act as shelters from fish predators differs between native and invasive amphipod prey,Aquatic Ecology,,['Biology'],Motor Control

"Multiple invasive species have now established at most locations around the world, and the rate of new species invasions and records of new invasive species continue to grow. Multiple invasive species interact in complex and unpredictable ways, altering their invasion success and impacts on biodiversity. Incumbent invasive species can be replaced by functionally similar invading species through competitive processes; however the generalized circumstances leading to such competitive displacement have not been well investigated. The likelihood of competitive displacement is a function of the incumbent advantage of the resident invasive species and the propagule pressure of the colonizing invasive species. We modeled interactions between populations of two functionally similar invasive species and indicated the circumstances under which dominance can be through propagule pressure and incumbent advantage. Under certain circumstances, a normally subordinate species can be incumbent and reject a colonizing dominant species, or successfully colonize in competition with a dominant species during simultaneous invasion. Our theoretical results are supported by empirical studies of the invasion of islands by three invasive Rattus species. Competitive displacement is prominent in invasive rats and explains the replacement of R. exulans on islands subsequently invaded by European populations of R. rattus and R. norvegicus. These competition outcomes between invasive species can be found in a broad range of taxa and biomes, and are likely to become more common. Conservation management must consider that removing an incumbent invasive species may facilitate invasion by another invasive species. Under very restricted circumstances of dominant competitive ability but lesser impact, competitive displacement may provide a novel method of biological control.",Russel et al,10.1890/13-1672.1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/376eb05b860a773c9919b0bbb117bfbccd7ff222,1,2000,Over-invasion by functionally equivalent invasive species,Ecology,,"['Biology', 'Medicine']",Motor Control

"The extinction of large herbivores, often keystone species, can dramatically modify plant communities and impose key biotic thresholds that may prevent an ecosystem returning to its previous state and threaten native biodiversity. A potentially innovative, yet controversial, landscape-based long-term restoration approach is to replace missing plant-herbivore interactions with non-native herbivores. Aldabran giant (Aldabrachelys gigantea) and Madagascan radiated (Astrochelys radiata) tortoises, taxonomically and functionally similar to the extinct Mauritian giant tortoises (Cylindraspis spp.), were introduced to Round Island, Mauritius, in 2007 to control the non-native plants that were threatening persistence of native species. We monitored the response of the plant community to tortoise grazing for 11 months in enclosures before the tortoises were released and, compared the cost of using tortoises as weeders with the cost of using manual labor. At the end of this period, plant biomass; vegetation height and cover; and adult, seedling, flower, and seed abundance were 3-136 times greater in adjacent control plots than in the tortoise enclosures. After their release, the free-roaming tortoises grazed on most non-native plants and significantly reduced vegetation cover, height, and seed production, reflecting findings from the enclosure study. The tortoises generally did not eat native species, although they consumed those native species that increased in abundance following the eradication of mammalian herbivores. Our results suggest that introduced non-native tortoises are a more cost-effective approach to control non-native vegetation than manual weeding. Numerous long-term outcomes (e.g., change in species composition and soil seed bank) are possible following tortoise releases. Monitoring and adaptive management are needed to ensure that the replacement herbivores promote the recovery of native plants.",Griffiths et al,10.1111/cobi.12087,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/074da1c0a109c0c03f8e78f6ac854b3ba71afa64,1,2000,Assessing the potential to restore historic grazing ecosystems with tortoise ecological replacements,Conservation biology : the journal of the Society for Conservation Biology,,"['Biology', 'Medicine']",Motor Control

"Biological invasions are often complex phenomena because many factors influence their outcome. One key aspect is how non-natives interact with the local biota. Interaction with local species may be especially important for exotic species that require an obligatory mutualist, such as Pinaceae species that need ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi. EM fungi and seeds of Pinaceae disperse independently, so they may use different vectors. We studied the role of exotic mammals as dispersal agents of EM fungi on Isla Victoria, Argentina, where many Pinaceae species have been introduced. Only a few of these tree species have become invasive, and they are found in high densities only near plantations, partly because these Pinaceae trees lack proper EM fungi when their seeds land far from plantations. Native mammals (a dwarf deer and rodents) are rare around plantations and do not appear to play a role in these invasions. With greenhouse experiments using animal feces as inoculum, plus observational and molecular studies, we found that wild boar and deer, both non-native, are dispersing EM fungi. Approximately 30% of the Pinaceae seedlings growing with feces of wild boar and 15% of the seedlings growing with deer feces were colonized by non-native EM fungi. Seedlings growing in control pots were not colonized by EM fungi. We found a low diversity of fungi colonizing the seedlings, with the hypogeous Rhizopogon as the most abundant genus. Wild boar, a recent introduction to the island, appear to be the main animal dispersing the fungi and may be playing a key role in facilitating the invasion of pine trees and even triggering their spread. These results show that interactions among non-natives help explain pine invasions in our study area.",Nuñez et al,10.1371/journal.pone.0066832,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1a96931c33f62a18d1f3a15d995dc669dd46f228,1,2000,Exotic mammals disperse exotic fungi that promote invasion by exotic trees,PloS one,,"['Biology', 'Medicine']",Motor Control

"Changes in land use patterns and vegetation can trigger ecological change in occupancy and community composition. Among the potential ecological consequences of land use change is altered susceptibility to occupancy by invasive species. We investigated the responses of three introduced mammals (red deer, Cervus elaphus; wild boar, Sus scrofa; and European hare, Lepus europaeus) to replacement of native vegetation by exotic pine plantations in the Patagonian forest-steppe ecotone using camera-trap surveys (8633 trap-days). We used logistic regression models to relate species presence with habitat variables at stand and landscape scales. Red deer and wild boar used pine plantations significantly more frequently than native vegetation. In contrast, occurrence of European hares did not differ between pine plantations and native vegetation, although hares were recorded more frequently in firebreaks than in plantations or native vegetation. Presence of red deer and wild boar was positively associated with cover of pine plantations at the landscape scale, and negatively associated with mid-storey cover and diversity at the stand scale. European hares preferred sites with low arboreal and mid-storey cover. Our results suggest that pine plantations promote increased abundances of invasive species whose original distributions are associated with woodlands (red deer and wild boar), and could act as source or pathways for invasive species to new areas.",Lantschner et al,10.1111/J.1442-9993.2012.02411.X,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4001c9a6ff855a14b9ba45eedcf35e86fec16b23,1,2000,Do exotic pine plantations favour the spread of invasive herbivorous mammals in Patagonia?,,,['Biology'],Motor Control

"The direct and indirect interactions of invasive ants with plants, insect herbivores, and Hemiptera are complex. While ant and Hemiptera interactions with native plants have been well studied, the effects of invasive ant–scale insect mutualisms on the reproductive output of invasive weeds have not. The study system consisted of Argentine ants (Linepithema humile), boneseed (Chrysanthemoides monilifera monilifera), and sap-sucking scale insects (Hemiptera: Saissetia oleae and Parasaissetia nigra), all of which are invasive in New Zealand. We examined the direct and indirect effects of Argentine ants on scale insects and other invertebrates (especially herbivores) and on plant reproductive output. Argentine ants spent one-third of their time specifically associated with scale insects in tending behaviours. The invertebrate community was significantly different between uninfested and infested plants, with fewer predators and herbivores on ant-infested plants. Herbivore damage was significantly reduced on plants with Argentine ants, but sooty mould colonisation was greater where ants were present. Herbivore damage increased when ants were excluded from plants. Boneseed plants infested with Argentine ants produced significantly more fruits than plants without ants. The increase in reproductive output in the presence of ants may be due to increased pollination as the result of pollinators being forced to relocate frequently to avoid attack by ants, resulting in an increase in pollen transfer and higher fruit/seed set. The consequences of Argentine ant invasion can be varied; not only does their invasion have consequences for maintaining biodiversity, ant invasion may also affect weed and pest management strategies.",Stanley et al,10.1007/s11829-012-9215-2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cf62ef44e30520cf95414956c3d03e31184a13c0,1,2000,Invasive interactions: can Argentine ants indirectly increase the reproductive output of a weed?,Arthropod-Plant Interactions,,['Biology'],Motor Control
"Dikerogammarus haemobaphes is one of several Ponto-Caspian gammarids invading Europe in recent decades. Previously, it exhibited active preferences for habitats associated with another Ponto-Caspian alien, zebra mussel. Now we tested gammarid preferences for living mussels and their empty shells with biofilm and/or periostracum present or absent, to find the exact cues driving gammarid responses. We observed a strong preference of gammarids for biofilmed shells, even if the biofilm was relatively young (2-day old). However, the biofilm quality, related to the substratum on which it had developed (shells with or without the periostracum, or coated with nail varnish) did not affect their behaviour. In the absence of biofilm, gammarids positively responded to the shell periostracum. Furthermore, they clearly preferred living zebra mussels over old empty shells, independent of the presence or absence of biofilm, confirming the importance of a periostracum-associated cue in their substratum recognition. On the other hand, shells obtained shortly after mussels’ death were preferred over living bivalves. Thus, the attractant is associated with fresh mussel shells, rather than with living mussels themselves. The ability of alien gammarids to locate sites inhabited by zebra mussels may contribute to their invasion success in novel areas inhabited by this habitat-forming bivalve.",Kobak et al,10.1007/s10750-012-1322-7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c00924440cff984d97eb1b28b2988d71145b5946,1,2000,The impact of zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) periostracum and biofilm cues on habitat selection by a Ponto-Caspian amphipod Dikerogammarus haemobaphes,Hydrobiologia,,['Biology'],Motor Control

"As the number of biological invasions increases, the potential for invader-invader interactions also rises. The effect of multiple invaders can be superadditive (invasional meltdown), additive, or subadditive (invasional interference); which of these situations occurs has critical implications for prioritization of management efforts. Carduus nutans and C. acanthoides, two congeneric invasive weeds, have a striking, segregated distribution in central Pennsylvania, U.S.A. Possible hypotheses for this pattern include invasion history and chance, direct competition, or negative interactions mediated by other species, such as shared pollinators. To explore the role of resource competition in generating this pattern, we conducted three related experiments using a response-surface design throughout the life cycles of two cohorts. Although these species have similar niche requirements, we found no differential response to competition between conspecifics vs. congeners. The response to combined density was relatively weak for both species. While direct competitive interactions do not explain the segregated distributional patterns of these two species, we predict that invasions of either species singly, or both species together, would have similar impacts. When prioritizing which areas to target to prevent the spread of one of the species, it is better to focus on areas as yet unaffected by its congener; where the congener is already present, invasional interference makes it unlikely that the net effect will change.","['Shea', 'Rauschert']",10.1890/11-2107.1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7999d67d20e4af36c971090ed5cd86146bd42566,1,2000,Invasional interference due to similar inter- and intraspecific competition between invaders may affect management,Ecological applications : a publication of the Ecological Society of America,,"['Biology', 'Medicine']",Motor Control

"Loss of biodiversity due to biological invasions is one of the most critical issues our society is facing. American mink is one of the most nefarious invasive non-native species and has major consequences for diversity, ecosystems and economics. A project to evaluate the impact of American mink has been carried out in Catalonia since 2000 under the aegis of regional and national government and a European LIFE programme. In this study, we tested whether temporal variations in the relative abundance of native species were related to American mink. In addition, we compared the abundance of natives before and after mink arrival. Among the competitors spotted genet and European polecat, mink abundance and arrival had a significant negative effect on their populations. However, among black rat and fish prey only three native fish species had a negative temporal relation with the abundance of mink and three fish species showed a significant difference in their abundance before and after mink arrival. The effect of mink was significant among species with a higher niche overlap (polecat and genet versus mink).

"In multiply invaded ecosystems, introduced species should interact with each other as well as with native species. Invader-invader interactions may affect the success of further invaders by altering attributes of recipient communities and propagule pressure. The invasional meltdown hypothesis (IMH) posits that positive interactions among invaders initiate positive population-level feedback that intensifies impacts and promotes secondary invasions. IMH remains controversial: few studies show feedback between invaders that amplifies their effects, and none yet demonstrate facilitation of entry and spread of secondary invaders. Our results show that supercolonies of an alien ant, promoted by mutualism with introduced honeydew-secreting scale insects, permitted invasion by an exotic land snail on Christmas Island, Indian Ocean. Modeling of land snail spread over 750 sites across 135 km2 over seven years showed that the probability of land snail invasion was facilitated 253-fold in ant supercolonies but impeded in intact forest where predaceous native land crabs remained abundant. Land snail occurrence at neighboring sites, a measure of propagule pressure, also promoted land snail spread. Site comparisons and experiments revealed that ant supercolonies, by killing land crabs but not land snails, disrupted biotic resistance and provided enemy-free space. Predation pressure on land snails was lower (28.6%), survival 115 times longer, and abundance 20-fold greater in supercolonies than in intact forest. Whole-ecosystem suppression of supercolonies reversed the probability of land snail invasion by allowing recolonization of land crabs; land snails were much less likely (0.79%) to invade sites where supercolonies were suppressed than where they remained intact. Our results provide strong empirical evidence for IMH by demonstrating that mutualism between invaders reconfigures key interactions in the recipient community. This facilitates entry of secondary invaders and elevates propagule pressure, propagating their spread at the whole-ecosystem level. We show that identification and management of key facilitative interactions in invaded ecosystems can be used to reverse impacts and restore resistance to further invasions.",Green et al,10.1890/11-0050.1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/54f2ae406e9285fec1e1f43c7adf43d67013898b,1,2000,Invasional meltdown.

"Ants are omnipresent in most terrestrial ecosystems, and plants have responded to their dominance by evolving traits that either facilitate positive interactions with ants or reduce negative ones. Because ants are generally poor pollinators, plants often protect their floral nectar against ants. Ants were historically absent from the geographically isolated Hawaiian archipelago, which harbors one of the most endemic floras in the world. We hypothesized that native Hawaiian plants lack floral features that exclude ants and therefore would be heavily exploited by introduced, invasive ants. To test this hypothesis, ant–flower interactions involving co-occurring native and introduced plants were observed in 10 sites on three Hawaiian Islands. We quantified the residual interaction strength of each pair of ant–plant species as the deviation of the observed interaction frequency from a null-model prediction based on available nectar sugar in a local plant community and local ant activity at sugar baits.

"The success of many alien plant species depends on mutualistic relationships with other species. We describe the assemblage of seed dispersers on three species of alien Opuntia invading Mediterranean and Macaronesian habitats, and examine the quality of such plant-animal interactions. We identified vertebrates consuming O. maxima, O. dillenii and O. stricta fruits by direct observation and collecting droppings and pellets. Phenology of the alien species, as well as that of coexisting native species, was monitored for an entire year. Germination tests of ingested and non-ingested seeds were performed both in the greenhouse and in the field. Seed coat thickness and viability were also measured for all treatments. A great variety of taxa, including reptiles, birds and mammals actively participate in the seed dispersal of Opuntia. Phenology of Opuntia fruits in Menorca and Tenerife overlaps with only a few native fleshy-fruited plants present in the study areas, which suggests an advantage for the invader. Most seeds germinated during the second year of the experiment, independently of the effect produced by the dispersers’ guts. We found great variation in the germination percentage of Opuntia after gut passage and in the effects of ingestion on seed coat thickness. Seed viability was somewhat reduced after gut passage compared to manually depulped seeds. Our results show how different Opuntia species are integrated into native communities by means of mutualistic interactions, with both native and alien dispersers. Although with heterogeneous effects, either type of disperser potentially contributes to the spread of these alien cacti in the recipient areas.",Padrón et al,10.1007/s10530-010-9872-y,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e67f56b6d190a544f590f2bccc5a091983eda828,1,2000,Integration of invasive Opuntia spp. by native and alien seed dispersers in the Mediterranean area and the Canary Islands,Biological Invasions,,['Biology'],Motor Control
"Invasive rodents are among the most ubiquitous and problematic species introduced to islands; more than 80% of the world’s island groups have been invaded. Introduced rats (black rat, Rattus rattus; Norway rat, R. norvegicus; Pacific rat, R. exulans) are well known as seed predators but are often overlooked as potential seed dispersers despite their common habit of transporting fruits and seeds prior to consumption. The relative likelihood of seed predation and dispersal by the black rat, which is the most common rat in Hawaiian forest, was tested with field and laboratory experiments. In the field, fruits of eight native and four non-native common woody plant species were arranged individually on the forest floor in four treatments that excluded vertebrates of different sizes. Eleven species had a portion (3–100%) of their fruits removed from vertebrate-accessible treatments, and automated cameras photographed only black rats removing fruit. In the laboratory, black rats were offered fruits of all 12 species to assess consumption and seed fate. Seeds of two species (non-native Clidemia hirta and native Kadua affinis) passed intact through the digestive tracts of rats. Most of the remaining larger-seeded species had their seeds chewed and destroyed, but for several of these, some partly damaged or undamaged seeds survived rat exposure. The combined field and laboratory findings indicate that many interactions between black rats and seeds of native and non-native plants may result in dispersal. Rats are likely to be affecting plant communities through both seed predation and dispersal.","['Drake', 'Shields']",10.1007/s10530-010-9876-7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e935432d52e0f431cde761856789a67bfa8d92db,1,2000,Are introduced rats (Rattus rattus) both seed predators and dispersers in Hawaii?,Biological Invasions,,['Biology'],Motor Control

"Understanding the influence of resident species on the success of invaders is a core objective in the study and management of biological invasions. We asked whether facultative food-for-protection mutualism between resident, nectar-feeding ants and extrafloral nectar-bearing plants confers biotic resistance to invasion by a specialist herbivore. Our research focused on the South American cactus-feeding moth Cactoblastis cactorum Berg (Lepidopetra: Pyralidae) in the panhandle region of Florida. This species has been widely and intentionally redistributed as a biological control agent against weedy cacti (Opuntia spp.) but arrived unintentionally in the southeast US, where it attacks native, non-target cacti and is considered a noxious invader. The acquired host-plants of C. cactorum in Florida secrete extrafloral nectar, especially on young, vegetative structures, and this attracts ants. We conducted ant-exclusion experiments over 2 years (2008 and 2009) at two sites using potted plants of two vulnerable host species (O. stricta and O. ficus-indica) to evaluate the influence of cactus-visiting ants (total of eight species) at multiple points in the moth life cycle (oviposition, egg survival, and larval survival). We found that the presence of ants often increased the mortality of lab-reared C. cactorum eggsticks (stacks of cohered eggs) and larvae that we introduced onto plants in the field, although these effects were variable across sites, years, host-plant species, ant species, and/or between old and young plant structures. In contrast to these “staged” encounters, we found that ants had little influence on the survival of cactus moths that occurred naturally at our field sites, or on moth damage and plant growth. In total, our experimental results suggest that the influence of cactus-visiting ants on C. cactorum invasion dynamics is weak and highly variable.",Miller et al,10.1007/s10530-010-9751-6,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9eeddc9953c12558de960b4cb8c910ad01d5f839,1,2000,Experimental test of biotic resistance to na invasive herbivore provided by potential plant mutualists,Biological Invasions,,['Biology'],Motor Control

"Endozoochory by exotic mammalian herbivores could modify vegetation composition by facilitating the dispersal and establishment of exotic and native plant species. We examined the potential for endozoochoric dispersal of native and exotic plants by exotic hog deer (Axis porcinus) in south-eastern Australia. We quantified the germinable seed content of hog deer faecal pellets collected in five vegetation types within a 10,500-ha study area that was representative of their Australian range. Twenty exotic and 22 native species germinated from hog deer faecal pellets and significantly more native species germinated compared to exotic species. Seedlings of the encroaching native shrub Acacia longifolia var. sophorae emerged, but no native trees emerged and the percentage of grasses that germinated was low (11%). The species composition of germinants was similar among the five vegetation types. We estimated that the hog deer population in our study area could potentially disperse >130,000 viable seeds daily.

"The spread of aquatic invasive species is a worldwide problem. In the aquatic environment, especially exotic Crustacea are affecting biodiversity. The amphipod Dikerogammarus villosus is such an exotic species in Flanders, which is rapidly spreading and probably has a serious impact on aquatic communities. The purpose of the present study was to make use of lab results, field data and modelling techniques to investigate the potential impact of this species on other macroinvertebrates. All types of prey that were used in predator–prey experiments ( Gammarus pulex , Gammarus tigrinus , Crangonyx pseudogracilis , Asellus aquaticus , Cloeon dipterum and Chironomus species) were consumed by D. villosus , especially species that were less mobile such as the Chironomus species. The presence of gravel somewhat reduced predation by providing shelter to the prey. Substrate preference experiments indicated that D. villosus preferred a stony substrate. Using decisions trees to construct habitat suitability models based on field observations, it could be concluded that D. villosus is mainly found in habitats with an artificial bank structure, a high oxygen saturation and a low conductivity, which corresponds with canals with a good chemical water quality. Moreover, a synecological classification tree, based on the abundance of the taxa present in the macroinvertebrate communities, indicated that the presence of D. villosus negatively affected the presence of the indigenous G. pulex . When the laboratory experiments and the field observations are combined, it can be concluded that D. villosus can seriously affect macroinvertebrate communities in Flanders.",Boets et al,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2009.12.005,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e0c4a4bed7ffaa25194f57c70e0333cec676ef4d,1,2000,Combining data-driven methods and lab studies to analyse the ecology of Dikerogammarus villosus,Ecol.

"What are the relative roles of mechanisms underlying plant responses in grassland communities invaded by both plants and mammals? What type of community can we expect in the future given current or novel conditions? We address these questions by comparing Markov chain community models among treatments from a field experiment on invasive species on Robinson Crusoe Island, Chile. Because of seed dispersal, grazing and disturbance, we predicted that the exotic European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) facilitates epizoochorous exotic plants (plants with seeds that stick to the skin an animal) at the expense of native plants. To test our hypothesis, we crossed rabbit exclosure treatments with disturbance treatments, and sampled the plant community in permanent plots over 3 years. We then estimated Markov chain model transition probabilities and found significant differences among treatments. As hypothesized, this modelling revealed that exotic plants survive better in disturbed areas, while natives prefer no rabbits or disturbance. Surprisingly, rabbits negatively affect epizoochorous plants. Markov chain dynamics indicate that an overall replacement of native plants by exotic plants is underway. Using a treatment-based approach to multi-species Markov chain models allowed us to examine the changes in the importance of mechanisms in response to experimental impacts on communities.","['Wooton', 'Nelis']",10.1098/rspb.2009.1564,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/20d7e5ff8754b84e9fdb5080ced85b01489b2787,1,2000,Treatment-based Markov chain models clarify mechanisms of invasion in na invaded grassland community,Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,,"['Biology', 'Medicine']",Motor Control

"SUMMARY*The absence of co-evolved mutualists of plants invading a novel habitat is the logical corollary of the more widely recognized 'enemy escape'. To avoid or overcome the loss of mutualists, plants may co-invade with nonnative mutualists, form novel associations with native mutualists or form associations with native cosmopolitan mutualists, which are native but not novel to the invading plant. *We tested these hypotheses by contrasting the ectomycorrhizal fungal communities associated with invasive Pinus contorta in New Zealand with co-occurring endemic Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides. *Fungal communities on Pinus were species poor (14 ectomycorrhizal species) and dominated by nonnative (93%) and cosmopolitan fungi (7%). Nothofagus had a species-rich (98 species) fungal community dominated by native Cortinarius and two cosmopolitan fungi. *These results support co-invasion by mutualists rather than novel associations as an important mechanism by which plants avoid or overcome the loss of mutualists, consistent with invasional meltdown.",Dickie et al,10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03277.x,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f61a6da8ecd64e33e562ea618630541832e09d4b,1,2000,Co-invasion by Pinus and its mycorrhizal fungi,The New phytologist,,"['Biology', 'Medicine']",Motor Control

"Summary 1. A common belief in invasion ecology is that invasive species are a major threat to biodiversity, but there is little evidence yet that competition from an exotic plant species has led to the extinction of any native plant species at the landscape scale. However, effects of invasive species at community and ecosystem levels can severely compromise conservation goals.  2. Our model species, the red quinine tree (Cinchona pubescens), was introduced to the Galapagos Islands in the 1940s and today extends over at least 11 000 ha in the highlands of Santa Cruz Island. It is also invasive on other oceanic islands.  3. We adopted a long-term approach, analysing permanent plots in the Fern-Sedge vegetation zone over 7 years, to test for impacts of C. pubescens density on resident plant species composition and on microclimate variables. We also tested whether the C. pubescens invasion facilitated the invasion of other species.  4. The rapid pace of the C. pubescens invasion was indicated by a more than doubling of percentage cover, a 4.6-fold increase in mean stand basal area and a 4-fold increase in the number of stems ha−1 in 7 years.  5. Photosynthetically active radiation was reduced by 87% under the C. pubescens canopy while precipitation increased because of enhanced fog interception.  6. Cinchona pubescens significantly decreased species diversity and the cover of most species by at least 50%. Endemic herbaceous species were more adversely affected than non-endemic native species. Stachys agraria, another invasive species, colonized bare ground that developed under the C. pubescens canopy.  7. The numbers of native, endemic and introduced species in the study area remained constant throughout the 7-year period.  8. Synthesis. This study clearly established C. pubescens as a habitat transformer, although its average cover did not exceed 20%. Despite the fact that no plant species has been lost completely from the study area so far, the introduction of the novel tree life form to a formerly treeless environment led to significant changes in stand structure and environmental conditions and to decreases in species diversity and cover. Such changes clearly conflict with conservation goals as set by the Convention on Biological Diversity.",Jäger et al,10.1111/J.1365-2745.2009.01578.X,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b092a3c4a67173d317e7887f10e5aaf106f4343d,1,2000,Destruction without extinction: long-term impacts of na invasive tree species on Galápagos highland vegetation,,,['Biology'],Motor Control
"A Ponto-Caspian amphipod Dikerogammarus haemobaphes has recently invaded European waters. In the recipient area, it encountered Dreissena polymorpha, a habitat-forming bivalve, co-occurring with the gammarids in their native range. We assumed that interspecific interactions between these two species, which could develop during their long-term co-evolution, may affect the gammarid behaviour in novel areas. We examined the gammarid ability to select a habitat containing living mussels and searched for cues used in that selection. We hypothesized that they may respond to such traits of a living mussel as byssal threads, activity (e.g. valve movements, filtration) and/or shell surface properties. We conducted the pairwise habitat-choice experiments in which we offered various objects to single gammarids in the following combinations: (1) living mussels versus empty shells (the general effect of living Dreissena); (2) living mussels versus shells with added byssal threads and shells with byssus versus shells without it (the effect of byssus); (3) living mussels versus shells, both coated with nail varnish to neutralize the shell surface (the effect of mussel activity); (4) varnished versus clean living mussels (the effect of shell surface); (5) varnished versus clean stones (the effect of varnish). We checked the gammarid positions in the experimental tanks after 24 h. The gammarids preferred clean living mussels over clean shells, regardless of the presence of byssal threads under the latter. They responded to the shell surface, exhibiting preferences for clean mussels over varnished individuals. They were neither affected by the presence of byssus nor by mussel activity. The ability to detect and actively select zebra mussel habitats may be beneficial for D. haemobaphes and help it establish stable populations in newly invaded areas.","['Zbikowski J', 'Poznanska M', 'Kakareko T', 'Kobak J']",10.1111/J.1469-7998.2009.00610.X,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4f6d55ab2b3edf6a2ce941574312c9195f0e2ef2,1,2000,Preferences of the Ponto-Caspian amphipod Dikerogammarus haemobaphes for living zebra mussels,,,['Biology'],Motor Control

"We used an invaded stream fish community in southern Chile to experimentally test whether the diversity of exotic species affects their competitive impact on a native species. In artificial enclosures an established invasive, rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, and a potential invader, Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, reduced the growth rate of native peladilla, Aplochiton zebra, by the same amount. In enclosures with both exotic salmonids, the growth rates of all three species were the same as in single exotic treatments. While neither species identity nor diversity appeared to affect competitive interactions in this experiment, the impact of salmonid diversity may vary with the type of interspecific interaction and/or the species identity of the exotics. Our experiment links two prominent concepts in invasion biology by testing whether the result of invasional meltdown, an increase in the diversity of exotic species, affects their impact through interspecific competition, the mechanism invoked by the biotic resistance hypothesis.",Young et al,10.1007/s10530-008-9372-5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eaaf807ba8094347812fb799c3982c070ced371f,1,2000,The diversity of juvenile salmonids does not affect their competitive impact on a native glaxiid,Biological Invasions,,['Biology'],Motor Control

"Mutualistic interactions between plants and animals promote integration of invasive species into native communities. In turn, the integrated invaders may alter existing patterns of mutualistic interactions. Here we simultaneously map in detail effects of invaders on parameters describing the topology of both plant-pollinator (bi-modal) and plant-plant (uni-modal) networks. We focus on the invader Opuntia spp., a cosmopolitan alien cactus. We compare two island systems: Tenerife (Canary Islands) and Menorca (Balearic Islands). Opuntia was found to modify the number of links between plants and pollinators, and was integrated into the new communities via the most generalist pollinators, but did not affect the general network pattern. The plant uni-modal networks showed disassortative linkage, i.e. species with many links tended to connect to species with few links. Thus, by linking to generalist natives, Opuntia remained peripheral to network topology, and this is probably why native network properties were not affected at least in one of the islands. We conclude that the network analytical approach is indeed a valuable tool to evaluate the effect of invaders on native communities.",Padrón et al,10.1371/journal.pone.0006275,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/465c07e30e5ca1d08de07b96b658a3034ed053e5,1,2000,Impact of alien plant invaders on pollination networks in two archipelagos,PloS one,,"['Biology', 'Medicine']",Motor Control

"Dominant tree species influence community and ecosystem components through the quantity and quality of their litter. Effects of litter may be modified by activity of ecosystem engineers such as earthworms. We examined the interacting effects of forest litter type and earthworm presence on invasibility of plants into forest floor environments using a greenhouse mesocosm experiment. We crossed five litter treatments mimicking historic and predicted changes in dominant tree composition with a treatment of either the absence or presence of nonnative earthworms. We measured mass loss of each litter type and growth of a model nonnative plant species (Festuca arundinacea, fescue) sown into each mesocosm. Mass loss was greater for litter of tree species characterized by lower C:N ratios. Earthworms enhanced litter mass loss, but only for species with lower C:N, leading to a significant litter × earthworm interaction. Fescue biomass was significantly greater in treatments with litter of low C:N and greater mass loss, suggesting that rapid decomposition of forest litter may be more favorable to understory plant invasions. Earthworms were expected to enhance invasion by increasing mass loss and removing the physical barrier of litter. However, earthworms typically reduced invasion success but not under invasive tree litter where the presence of earthworms facilitated invasion success compared to other litter treatments where earthworms were present. We conclude that past and predicted future shifts in dominant tree species may influence forest understory invasibility. The presence of nonnative earthworms may either suppress of facilitate invasibility depending on the species of dominant overstory tree species and the litter layers they produce.","['Jones', 'Belote']",10.1007/s10530-008-9315-1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/67de47d8127c1a788aa6b116c99b7f32bea36a0c,1,2000,Tree leaf litter composition and nonnative earthworms influence plant invasion in experimental forest floor mosocosms,Biological Invasions,,['Biology'],Motor Control

"Aquatic macrophytes play an important role in the survival and proliferation of invertebrates in freshwater ecosystems. Epiphytic invertebrate communities may be altered through the replacement of native macrophytes by exotic macrophytes, even when the macrophytes are close relatives and have similar morphology. We sampled an invasive exotic macrophyte, Eurasian watermilfoil ( Myriophyllum spicatum ), and native milfoils Myriophyllum sibericum and Myriophyllum alterniflorum in four bodies of water in southern Quebec and upstate New York during the summer of 2005. Within each waterbody, we compared the abundance, diversity, and community composition of epiphytic macroinvertebrates on exotic and native Myriophyllum. In general, both M. sibericum and M. alterniflorum had higher invertebrate diversity and higher invertebrate biomass and supported more gastropods than the exotic M. spicatum. In late summer, invertebrate density tended to be higher on M. sibericum than on M. spicatum, but lower on M. alterniflorum than on M. spicatum. Our results demonstrate that M. spicatum supports macroinvertebrate communities that may differ from those on structurally similar native macrophytes, although these differences vary across sites and sampling dates. Thus, the replacement of native milfoils by M. spicatum may have indirect effects on aquatic food webs.","['Ricciardi', 'Wilson']",10.1139/f08-187,http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f08-187,1,2000,Epiphytic macroinvertebrate communities on Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) and native milfoils Myriophyllum sibericum and Myriophyllum alterniflorum in eastern North America,['Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences'],"(['Aquatic Science', 'Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics'],)",,Motor Control

"Many studies have shown that plant or bird invasions can be facilitated by native species, but few have demonstrated the possibility of a positive interaction between introduced species. We analysed the relationships between four invasive alien fleshy-fruited plants, Clidemia hirta, Rubus alceifolius, Lantana camara, Schinus terebinthifolius, and an invasive alien bird, the red-whiskered bulbul Pycnonotus jocosus introduced to Reunion Island (Indian Ocean). We compared the distribution of food items in the bulbul diet according to seasons and to abundance classes of this bird. Pycnonotus jocosus is mostly frugivorous and frequently eats the main alien plants (more than 80% frequency of food items). Sites with alien species, such as Clidemia hirta, providing fruits throughout the year supported more birds than sites providing fruits, such as Schinus terebinthifolius, seasonally. The birds facilitated seed germination by removing the pulp of fruit: the final per cent germination (FG) of cleaned seeds was higher than those within the fruit for three of the four plant species and in some cases passage through birds significantly increased FG (Schinus terebinthifolius) or Coefficient of Velocity (CV) (Lantana camara).",Mandon-Dalger et al,10.1017/s0266467404001774,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0266467404001774,1,2000,Relationship betwen alien plants and na alien bird species on Reunion island,['Journal of Tropical Ecology'],"(['Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics'],)",,Motor Control

"Biological invasions are often complex phenomena because many factors influence their outcome. One key aspect is how non-natives interact with the local biota. Interaction with local species may be especially important for exotic species that require an obligatory mutualist, such as Pinaceae species that need ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi. EM fungi and seeds of Pinaceae disperse independently, so they may use different vectors. We studied the role of exotic mammals as dispersal agents of EM fungi on Isla Victoria, Argentina, where many Pinaceae species have been introduced. Only a few of these tree species have become invasive, and they are found in high densities only near plantations, partly because these Pinaceae trees lack proper EM fungi when their seeds land far from plantations. Native mammals (a dwarf deer and rodents) are rare around plantations and do not appear to play a role in these invasions. With greenhouse experiments using animal feces as inoculum, plus observational and molecular studies, we found that wild boar and deer, both non-native, are dispersing EM fungi. Approximately 30% of the Pinaceae seedlings growing with feces of wild boar and 15% of the seedlings growing with deer feces were colonized by non-native EM fungi. Seedlings growing in control pots were not colonized by EM fungi. We found a low diversity of fungi colonizing the seedlings, with the hypogeous Rhizopogon as the most abundant genus. Wild boar, a recent introduction to the island, appear to be the main animal dispersing the fungi and may be playing a key role in facilitating the invasion of pine trees and even triggering their spread. These results show that interactions among non-natives help explain pine invasions in our study area.",Nuñez et al,10.1371/journal.pone.0066832,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1a96931c33f62a18d1f3a15d995dc669dd46f228,0,0,Exotic mammals disperse exotic fungi that promote invasion by exotic trees,PloS one,,"['Biology', 'Medicine']",Motor Control

"Changes in land use patterns and vegetation can trigger ecological change in occupancy and community composition. Among the potential ecological consequences of land use change is altered susceptibility to occupancy by invasive species. We investigated the responses of three introduced mammals (red deer, Cervus elaphus; wild boar, Sus scrofa; and European hare, Lepus europaeus) to replacement of native vegetation by exotic pine plantations in the Patagonian forest-steppe ecotone using camera-trap surveys (8633 trap-days). We used logistic regression models to relate species presence with habitat variables at stand and landscape scales. Red deer and wild boar used pine plantations significantly more frequently than native vegetation. In contrast, occurrence of European hares did not differ between pine plantations and native vegetation, although hares were recorded more frequently in firebreaks than in plantations or native vegetation. Presence of red deer and wild boar was positively associated with cover of pine plantations at the landscape scale, and negatively associated with mid-storey cover and diversity at the stand scale. European hares preferred sites with low arboreal and mid-storey cover. Our results suggest that pine plantations promote increased abundances of invasive species whose original distributions are associated with woodlands (red deer and wild boar), and could act as source or pathways for invasive species to new areas.",Lantschner et al,10.1111/J.1442-9993.2012.02411.X,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4001c9a6ff855a14b9ba45eedcf35e86fec16b23,0,0,Do exotic pine plantations favour the spread of invasive herbivorous mammals in Patagonia?,,,['Biology'],Motor Control

"The direct and indirect interactions of invasive ants with plants, insect herbivores, and Hemiptera are complex. While ant and Hemiptera interactions with native plants have been well studied, the effects of invasive ant–scale insect mutualisms on the reproductive output of invasive weeds have not. The study system consisted of Argentine ants (Linepithema humile), boneseed (Chrysanthemoides monilifera monilifera), and sap-sucking scale insects (Hemiptera: Saissetia oleae and Parasaissetia nigra), all of which are invasive in New Zealand. We examined the direct and indirect effects of Argentine ants on scale insects and other invertebrates (especially herbivores) and on plant reproductive output. Argentine ants spent one-third of their time specifically associated with scale insects in tending behaviours. The invertebrate community was significantly different between uninfested and infested plants, with fewer predators and herbivores on ant-infested plants. Herbivore damage was significantly reduced on plants with Argentine ants, but sooty mould colonisation was greater where ants were present. Herbivore damage increased when ants were excluded from plants. Boneseed plants infested with Argentine ants produced significantly more fruits than plants without ants. The increase in reproductive output in the presence of ants may be due to increased pollination as the result of pollinators being forced to relocate frequently to avoid attack by ants, resulting in an increase in pollen transfer and higher fruit/seed set. The consequences of Argentine ant invasion can be varied; not only does their invasion have consequences for maintaining biodiversity, ant invasion may also affect weed and pest management strategies.",Stanley et al,10.1007/s11829-012-9215-2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cf62ef44e30520cf95414956c3d03e31184a13c0,0,0,Invasive interactions: can Argentine ants indirectly increase the reproductive output of a weed?,Arthropod-Plant Interactions,,['Biology'],Motor Control
"Dikerogammarus haemobaphes is one of several Ponto-Caspian gammarids invading Europe in recent decades. Previously, it exhibited active preferences for habitats associated with another Ponto-Caspian alien, zebra mussel. Now we tested gammarid preferences for living mussels and their empty shells with biofilm and/or periostracum present or absent, to find the exact cues driving gammarid responses. We observed a strong preference of gammarids for biofilmed shells, even if the biofilm was relatively young (2-day old). However, the biofilm quality, related to the substratum on which it had developed (shells with or without the periostracum, or coated with nail varnish) did not affect their behaviour. In the absence of biofilm, gammarids positively responded to the shell periostracum. Furthermore, they clearly preferred living zebra mussels over old empty shells, independent of the presence or absence of biofilm, confirming the importance of a periostracum-associated cue in their substratum recognition. On the other hand, shells obtained shortly after mussels’ death were preferred over living bivalves. Thus, the attractant is associated with fresh mussel shells, rather than with living mussels themselves. The ability of alien gammarids to locate sites inhabited by zebra mussels may contribute to their invasion success in novel areas inhabited by this habitat-forming bivalve.",Kobak et al,10.1007/s10750-012-1322-7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c00924440cff984d97eb1b28b2988d71145b5946,0,0,The impact of zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) periostracum and biofilm cues on habitat selection by a Ponto-Caspian amphipod Dikerogammarus haemobaphes,Hydrobiologia,,['Biology'],Motor Control

"As the number of biological invasions increases, the potential for invader-invader interactions also rises. The effect of multiple invaders can be superadditive (invasional meltdown), additive, or subadditive (invasional interference); which of these situations occurs has critical implications for prioritization of management efforts. Carduus nutans and C. acanthoides, two congeneric invasive weeds, have a striking, segregated distribution in central Pennsylvania, U.S.A. Possible hypotheses for this pattern include invasion history and chance, direct competition, or negative interactions mediated by other species, such as shared pollinators. To explore the role of resource competition in generating this pattern, we conducted three related experiments using a response-surface design throughout the life cycles of two cohorts. Although these species have similar niche requirements, we found no differential response to competition between conspecifics vs. congeners. The response to combined density was relatively weak for both species. While direct competitive interactions do not explain the segregated distributional patterns of these two species, we predict that invasions of either species singly, or both species together, would have similar impacts. When prioritizing which areas to target to prevent the spread of one of the species, it is better to focus on areas as yet unaffected by its congener; where the congener is already present, invasional interference makes it unlikely that the net effect will change.","['Shea', 'Rauschert']",10.1890/11-2107.1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7999d67d20e4af36c971090ed5cd86146bd42566,0,0,Invasional interference due to similar inter- and intraspecific competition between invaders may affect management,Ecological applications : a publication of the Ecological Society of America,,"['Biology', 'Medicine']",Motor Control

"Loss of biodiversity due to biological invasions is one of the most critical issues our society is facing. American mink is one of the most nefarious invasive non-native species and has major consequences for diversity, ecosystems and economics. A project to evaluate the impact of American mink has been carried out in Catalonia since 2000 under the aegis of regional and national government and a European LIFE programme. In this study, we tested whether temporal variations in the relative abundance of native species were related to American mink. In addition, we compared the abundance of natives before and after mink arrival. Among the competitors spotted genet and European polecat, mink abundance and arrival had a significant negative effect on their populations. However, among black rat and fish prey only three native fish species had a negative temporal relation with the abundance of mink and three fish species showed a significant difference in their abundance before and after mink arrival. The effect of mink was significant among species with a higher niche overlap (polecat and genet versus mink).

"In multiply invaded ecosystems, introduced species should interact with each other as well as with native species. Invader-invader interactions may affect the success of further invaders by altering attributes of recipient communities and propagule pressure. The invasional meltdown hypothesis (IMH) posits that positive interactions among invaders initiate positive population-level feedback that intensifies impacts and promotes secondary invasions. IMH remains controversial: few studies show feedback between invaders that amplifies their effects, and none yet demonstrate facilitation of entry and spread of secondary invaders. Our results show that supercolonies of an alien ant, promoted by mutualism with introduced honeydew-secreting scale insects, permitted invasion by an exotic land snail on Christmas Island, Indian Ocean. Modeling of land snail spread over 750 sites across 135 km2 over seven years showed that the probability of land snail invasion was facilitated 253-fold in ant supercolonies but impeded in intact forest where predaceous native land crabs remained abundant. Land snail occurrence at neighboring sites, a measure of propagule pressure, also promoted land snail spread. Site comparisons and experiments revealed that ant supercolonies, by killing land crabs but not land snails, disrupted biotic resistance and provided enemy-free space. Predation pressure on land snails was lower (28.6%), survival 115 times longer, and abundance 20-fold greater in supercolonies than in intact forest. Whole-ecosystem suppression of supercolonies reversed the probability of land snail invasion by allowing recolonization of land crabs; land snails were much less likely (0.79%) to invade sites where supercolonies were suppressed than where they remained intact. Our results provide strong empirical evidence for IMH by demonstrating that mutualism between invaders reconfigures key interactions in the recipient community. This facilitates entry of secondary invaders and elevates propagule pressure, propagating their spread at the whole-ecosystem level. We show that identification and management of key facilitative interactions in invaded ecosystems can be used to reverse impacts and restore resistance to further invasions.",Green et al,10.1890/11-0050.1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/54f2ae406e9285fec1e1f43c7adf43d67013898b,0,0,Invasional meltdown.

"Ants are omnipresent in most terrestrial ecosystems, and plants have responded to their dominance by evolving traits that either facilitate positive interactions with ants or reduce negative ones. Because ants are generally poor pollinators, plants often protect their floral nectar against ants. Ants were historically absent from the geographically isolated Hawaiian archipelago, which harbors one of the most endemic floras in the world. We hypothesized that native Hawaiian plants lack floral features that exclude ants and therefore would be heavily exploited by introduced, invasive ants. To test this hypothesis, ant–flower interactions involving co-occurring native and introduced plants were observed in 10 sites on three Hawaiian Islands. We quantified the residual interaction strength of each pair of ant–plant species as the deviation of the observed interaction frequency from a null-model prediction based on available nectar sugar in a local plant community and local ant activity at sugar baits.

"The success of many alien plant species depends on mutualistic relationships with other species. We describe the assemblage of seed dispersers on three species of alien Opuntia invading Mediterranean and Macaronesian habitats, and examine the quality of such plant-animal interactions. We identified vertebrates consuming O. maxima, O. dillenii and O. stricta fruits by direct observation and collecting droppings and pellets. Phenology of the alien species, as well as that of coexisting native species, was monitored for an entire year. Germination tests of ingested and non-ingested seeds were performed both in the greenhouse and in the field. Seed coat thickness and viability were also measured for all treatments. A great variety of taxa, including reptiles, birds and mammals actively participate in the seed dispersal of Opuntia. Phenology of Opuntia fruits in Menorca and Tenerife overlaps with only a few native fleshy-fruited plants present in the study areas, which suggests an advantage for the invader. Most seeds germinated during the second year of the experiment, independently of the effect produced by the dispersers’ guts. We found great variation in the germination percentage of Opuntia after gut passage and in the effects of ingestion on seed coat thickness. Seed viability was somewhat reduced after gut passage compared to manually depulped seeds. Our results show how different Opuntia species are integrated into native communities by means of mutualistic interactions, with both native and alien dispersers. Although with heterogeneous effects, either type of disperser potentially contributes to the spread of these alien cacti in the recipient areas.",Padrón et al,10.1007/s10530-010-9872-y,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e67f56b6d190a544f590f2bccc5a091983eda828,0,0,Integration of invasive Opuntia spp. by native and alien seed dispersers in the Mediterranean area and the Canary Islands,Biological Invasions,,['Biology'],Motor Control
"Invasive rodents are among the most ubiquitous and problematic species introduced to islands; more than 80% of the world’s island groups have been invaded. Introduced rats (black rat, Rattus rattus; Norway rat, R. norvegicus; Pacific rat, R. exulans) are well known as seed predators but are often overlooked as potential seed dispersers despite their common habit of transporting fruits and seeds prior to consumption. The relative likelihood of seed predation and dispersal by the black rat, which is the most common rat in Hawaiian forest, was tested with field and laboratory experiments. In the field, fruits of eight native and four non-native common woody plant species were arranged individually on the forest floor in four treatments that excluded vertebrates of different sizes. Eleven species had a portion (3–100%) of their fruits removed from vertebrate-accessible treatments, and automated cameras photographed only black rats removing fruit. In the laboratory, black rats were offered fruits of all 12 species to assess consumption and seed fate. Seeds of two species (non-native Clidemia hirta and native Kadua affinis) passed intact through the digestive tracts of rats. Most of the remaining larger-seeded species had their seeds chewed and destroyed, but for several of these, some partly damaged or undamaged seeds survived rat exposure. The combined field and laboratory findings indicate that many interactions between black rats and seeds of native and non-native plants may result in dispersal. Rats are likely to be affecting plant communities through both seed predation and dispersal.","['Drake', 'Shields']",10.1007/s10530-010-9876-7,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e935432d52e0f431cde761856789a67bfa8d92db,0,0,Are introduced rats (Rattus rattus) both seed predators and dispersers in Hawaii?,Biological Invasions,,['Biology'],Motor Control

"Understanding the influence of resident species on the success of invaders is a core objective in the study and management of biological invasions. We asked whether facultative food-for-protection mutualism between resident, nectar-feeding ants and extrafloral nectar-bearing plants confers biotic resistance to invasion by a specialist herbivore. Our research focused on the South American cactus-feeding moth Cactoblastis cactorum Berg (Lepidopetra: Pyralidae) in the panhandle region of Florida. This species has been widely and intentionally redistributed as a biological control agent against weedy cacti (Opuntia spp.) but arrived unintentionally in the southeast US, where it attacks native, non-target cacti and is considered a noxious invader. The acquired host-plants of C. cactorum in Florida secrete extrafloral nectar, especially on young, vegetative structures, and this attracts ants. We conducted ant-exclusion experiments over 2 years (2008 and 2009) at two sites using potted plants of two vulnerable host species (O. stricta and O. ficus-indica) to evaluate the influence of cactus-visiting ants (total of eight species) at multiple points in the moth life cycle (oviposition, egg survival, and larval survival). We found that the presence of ants often increased the mortality of lab-reared C. cactorum eggsticks (stacks of cohered eggs) and larvae that we introduced onto plants in the field, although these effects were variable across sites, years, host-plant species, ant species, and/or between old and young plant structures. In contrast to these “staged” encounters, we found that ants had little influence on the survival of cactus moths that occurred naturally at our field sites, or on moth damage and plant growth. In total, our experimental results suggest that the influence of cactus-visiting ants on C. cactorum invasion dynamics is weak and highly variable.",Miller et al,10.1007/s10530-010-9751-6,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9eeddc9953c12558de960b4cb8c910ad01d5f839,0,0,Experimental test of biotic resistance to na invasive herbivore provided by potential plant mutualists,Biological Invasions,,['Biology'],Motor Control

We examined the potential for endozoochoric dispersal of native and exotic plants by exotic hog deer (Axis porcinus) in south-eastern Australia. We quantified the germinable seed content of hog deer faecal pellets collected in five vegetation types within a 10,500-ha study area that was representative of their Australian range. Twenty exotic and 22 native species germinated from hog deer faecal pellets and significantly more native species germinated compared to exotic species. Seedlings of the encroaching native shrub Acacia longifolia var. sophorae emerged, but no native trees emerged and the percentage of grasses that germinated was low (11%). The species composition of germinants was similar among the five vegetation types. We estimated that the hog deer population in our study area could potentially disperse >130,000 viable seeds daily.

"The spread of aquatic invasive species is a worldwide problem. In the aquatic environment, especially exotic Crustacea are affecting biodiversity. The amphipod Dikerogammarus villosus is such an exotic species in Flanders, which is rapidly spreading and probably has a serious impact on aquatic communities. The purpose of the present study was to make use of lab results, field data and modelling techniques to investigate the potential impact of this species on other macroinvertebrates. All types of prey that were used in predator–prey experiments ( Gammarus pulex , Gammarus tigrinus , Crangonyx pseudogracilis , Asellus aquaticus , Cloeon dipterum and Chironomus species) were consumed by D. villosus , especially species that were less mobile such as the Chironomus species. The presence of gravel somewhat reduced predation by providing shelter to the prey. Substrate preference experiments indicated that D. villosus preferred a stony substrate. Using decisions trees to construct habitat suitability models based on field observations, it could be concluded that D. villosus is mainly found in habitats with an artificial bank structure, a high oxygen saturation and a low conductivity, which corresponds with canals with a good chemical water quality. Moreover, a synecological classification tree, based on the abundance of the taxa present in the macroinvertebrate communities, indicated that the presence of D. villosus negatively affected the presence of the indigenous G. pulex . When the laboratory experiments and the field observations are combined, it can be concluded that D. villosus can seriously affect macroinvertebrate communities in Flanders.",Boets et al,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2009.12.005,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e0c4a4bed7ffaa25194f57c70e0333cec676ef4d,0,0,Combining data-driven methods and lab studies to analyse the ecology of Dikerogammarus villosus,Ecol.

"What are the relative roles of mechanisms underlying plant responses in grassland communities invaded by both plants and mammals? What type of community can we expect in the future given current or novel conditions? We address these questions by comparing Markov chain community models among treatments from a field experiment on invasive species on Robinson Crusoe Island, Chile. Because of seed dispersal, grazing and disturbance, we predicted that the exotic European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) facilitates epizoochorous exotic plants (plants with seeds that stick to the skin an animal) at the expense of native plants. To test our hypothesis, we crossed rabbit exclosure treatments with disturbance treatments, and sampled the plant community in permanent plots over 3 years. We then estimated Markov chain model transition probabilities and found significant differences among treatments. As hypothesized, this modelling revealed that exotic plants survive better in disturbed areas, while natives prefer no rabbits or disturbance. Surprisingly, rabbits negatively affect epizoochorous plants. Markov chain dynamics indicate that an overall replacement of native plants by exotic plants is underway. Using a treatment-based approach to multi-species Markov chain models allowed us to examine the changes in the importance of mechanisms in response to experimental impacts on communities.","['Wooton', 'Nelis']",10.1098/rspb.2009.1564,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/20d7e5ff8754b84e9fdb5080ced85b01489b2787,0,0,Treatment-based Markov chain models clarify mechanisms of invasion in na invaded grassland community,Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,,"['Biology', 'Medicine']",Motor Control

Areas com densa bioincrustacao foram raspadas e as especies foram posteriormente classificadas em relacao ao status de bioinvasao no litoral brasileiro. Dentre as especies identificadas, seis eram nativas do Brasil, duas criptogenicas e 16 exoticas. Destas, oito foram classificadas como estabelecidas (Musculus lateralis, Sphenia fragilis, Balanus trigonus, Biflustra savartii, Botrylloides nigrum, Didemnum psammatodes, Herdmania pallida, Microscosmus exasperatus, Symplegma rubra) e tres como invasoras (Mytilopsis leucophaeta, Amphibalanus reticulatus e Striatobalanus amaryllis).

"SUMMARY*The absence of co-evolved mutualists of plants invading a novel habitat is the logical corollary of the more widely recognized 'enemy escape'. To avoid or overcome the loss of mutualists, plants may co-invade with nonnative mutualists, form novel associations with native mutualists or form associations with native cosmopolitan mutualists, which are native but not novel to the invading plant. *We tested these hypotheses by contrasting the ectomycorrhizal fungal communities associated with invasive Pinus contorta in New Zealand with co-occurring endemic Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides. *Fungal communities on Pinus were species poor (14 ectomycorrhizal species) and dominated by nonnative (93%) and cosmopolitan fungi (7%). Nothofagus had a species-rich (98 species) fungal community dominated by native Cortinarius and two cosmopolitan fungi. *These results support co-invasion by mutualists rather than novel associations as an important mechanism by which plants avoid or overcome the loss of mutualists, consistent with invasional meltdown.",Dickie et al,10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03277.x,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f61a6da8ecd64e33e562ea618630541832e09d4b,0,0,Co-invasion by Pinus and its mycorrhizal fungi,The New phytologist,,"['Biology', 'Medicine']",Motor Control
"As invasion rates of exotic species increase, an ecosystem level understanding of their impacts is imperative for predicting future spread and consequences. We have previously shown that network analyses are powerful tools for understanding the effects of exotic species perturbation on ecosystems. We now use the network analysis approach to compare how the same perturbation affects another ecosystem of similar trophic status. We compared food web characteristics of the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario (Canada), to previous research on Oneida Lake, New York (USA) before and after zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) invasion. We used ecological network analysis (ENA) to rigorously quantify ecosystem function through an analysis of direct and indirect food web transfers. We used a social network analysis method, cohesion analysis (CA), to assess ecosystem structure by organizing food web members into subgroups of strongly interacting predators and prey. Together, ENA and CA allowed us to understand how food web structure and function respond simultaneously to perturbation. In general, zebra mussel effects on the Bay of Quinte, when compared to Oneida Lake, were similar in direction, but greater in magnitude. Both systems underwent functional changes involving focused flow through a small number of taxa and increased use of benthic sources of production; additionally, both systems structurally changed with subgroup membership changing considerably (33% in Oneida Lake) or being disrupted entirely (in the Bay of Quinte). However, the response of total ecosystem activity (as measured by carbon flow) differed between both systems, with increasing activity in the Bay of Quinte, and decreasing activity in Oneida Lake. Thus, these analyses revealed parallel effects of zebra mussel invasion in ecosystems of similar trophic status, yet they also suggested that important differences may exist. As exotic species continue to disrupt the structure and function of our native ecosystems, food web network analyses will be useful for understanding their far-reaching effects.",Miehls et al,10.1016/J.ECOLMODEL.2009.07.013,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c7d31fabdc78ced08b25c525bf690378ac259c3,0,0,"Invasive species impacts on ecosystem structure and function: A comparison of the Bay of Quinte, Canada, and Oneida Lake, USA, before and after zebra mussel invasion",,,['Biology'],Motor Control

"Summary 1. A common belief in invasion ecology is that invasive species are a major threat to biodiversity, but there is little evidence yet that competition from an exotic plant species has led to the extinction of any native plant species at the landscape scale. However, effects of invasive species at community and ecosystem levels can severely compromise conservation goals.  2. Our model species, the red quinine tree (Cinchona pubescens), was introduced to the Galapagos Islands in the 1940s and today extends over at least 11 000 ha in the highlands of Santa Cruz Island. It is also invasive on other oceanic islands.  3. We adopted a long-term approach, analysing permanent plots in the Fern-Sedge vegetation zone over 7 years, to test for impacts of C. pubescens density on resident plant species composition and on microclimate variables. We also tested whether the C. pubescens invasion facilitated the invasion of other species.  4. The rapid pace of the C. pubescens invasion was indicated by a more than doubling of percentage cover, a 4.6-fold increase in mean stand basal area and a 4-fold increase in the number of stems ha−1 in 7 years.  5. Photosynthetically active radiation was reduced by 87% under the C. pubescens canopy while precipitation increased because of enhanced fog interception.  6. Cinchona pubescens significantly decreased species diversity and the cover of most species by at least 50%. Endemic herbaceous species were more adversely affected than non-endemic native species. Stachys agraria, another invasive species, colonized bare ground that developed under the C. pubescens canopy.  7. The numbers of native, endemic and introduced species in the study area remained constant throughout the 7-year period.  8. Synthesis. This study clearly established C. pubescens as a habitat transformer, although its average cover did not exceed 20%. Despite the fact that no plant species has been lost completely from the study area so far, the introduction of the novel tree life form to a formerly treeless environment led to significant changes in stand structure and environmental conditions and to decreases in species diversity and cover. Such changes clearly conflict with conservation goals as set by the Convention on Biological Diversity.",Jäger et al,10.1111/J.1365-2745.2009.01578.X,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b092a3c4a67173d317e7887f10e5aaf106f4343d,0,0,Destruction without extinction: long-term impacts of na invasive tree species on Galápagos highland vegetation,,,['Biology'],Motor Control
"A Ponto-Caspian amphipod Dikerogammarus haemobaphes has recently invaded European waters. In the recipient area, it encountered Dreissena polymorpha, a habitat-forming bivalve, co-occurring with the gammarids in their native range. We assumed that interspecific interactions between these two species, which could develop during their long-term co-evolution, may affect the gammarid behaviour in novel areas. We examined the gammarid ability to select a habitat containing living mussels and searched for cues used in that selection. We hypothesized that they may respond to such traits of a living mussel as byssal threads, activity (e.g. valve movements, filtration) and/or shell surface properties. We conducted the pairwise habitat-choice experiments in which we offered various objects to single gammarids in the following combinations: (1) living mussels versus empty shells (the general effect of living Dreissena); (2) living mussels versus shells with added byssal threads and shells with byssus versus shells without it (the effect of byssus); (3) living mussels versus shells, both coated with nail varnish to neutralize the shell surface (the effect of mussel activity); (4) varnished versus clean living mussels (the effect of shell surface); (5) varnished versus clean stones (the effect of varnish). We checked the gammarid positions in the experimental tanks after 24 h. The gammarids preferred clean living mussels over clean shells, regardless of the presence of byssal threads under the latter. They responded to the shell surface, exhibiting preferences for clean mussels over varnished individuals. They were neither affected by the presence of byssus nor by mussel activity. The ability to detect and actively select zebra mussel habitats may be beneficial for D. haemobaphes and help it establish stable populations in newly invaded areas.","['Zbikowski J', 'Poznanska M', 'Kakareko T', 'Kobak J']",10.1111/J.1469-7998.2009.00610.X,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4f6d55ab2b3edf6a2ce941574312c9195f0e2ef2,0,0,Preferences of the Ponto-Caspian amphipod Dikerogammarus haemobaphes for living zebra mussels,,,['Biology'],Motor Control

"We used an invaded stream fish community in southern Chile to experimentally test whether the diversity of exotic species affects their competitive impact on a native species. In artificial enclosures an established invasive, rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, and a potential invader, Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, reduced the growth rate of native peladilla, Aplochiton zebra, by the same amount. In enclosures with both exotic salmonids, the growth rates of all three species were the same as in single exotic treatments. While neither species identity nor diversity appeared to affect competitive interactions in this experiment, the impact of salmonid diversity may vary with the type of interspecific interaction and/or the species identity of the exotics. Our experiment links two prominent concepts in invasion biology by testing whether the result of invasional meltdown, an increase in the diversity of exotic species, affects their impact through interspecific competition, the mechanism invoked by the biotic resistance hypothesis.",Young et al,10.1007/s10530-008-9372-5,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eaaf807ba8094347812fb799c3982c070ced371f,0,0,The diversity of juvenile salmonids does not affect their competitive impact on a native glaxiid,Biological Invasions,,['Biology'],Motor Control

"Mutualistic interactions between plants and animals promote integration of invasive species into native communities. In turn, the integrated invaders may alter existing patterns of mutualistic interactions. Here we simultaneously map in detail effects of invaders on parameters describing the topology of both plant-pollinator (bi-modal) and plant-plant (uni-modal) networks. We focus on the invader Opuntia spp., a cosmopolitan alien cactus. We compare two island systems: Tenerife (Canary Islands) and Menorca (Balearic Islands). Opuntia was found to modify the number of links between plants and pollinators, and was integrated into the new communities via the most generalist pollinators, but did not affect the general network pattern. The plant uni-modal networks showed disassortative linkage, i.e. species with many links tended to connect to species with few links. Thus, by linking to generalist natives, Opuntia remained peripheral to network topology, and this is probably why native network properties were not affected at least in one of the islands. We conclude that the network analytical approach is indeed a valuable tool to evaluate the effect of invaders on native communities.",Padrón et al,10.1371/journal.pone.0006275,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/465c07e30e5ca1d08de07b96b658a3034ed053e5,0,0,Impact of alien plant invaders on pollination networks in two archipelagos,PloS one,,"['Biology', 'Medicine']",Motor Control

"Dominant tree species influence community and ecosystem components through the quantity and quality of their litter. Effects of litter may be modified by activity of ecosystem engineers such as earthworms. We examined the interacting effects of forest litter type and earthworm presence on invasibility of plants into forest floor environments using a greenhouse mesocosm experiment. We crossed five litter treatments mimicking historic and predicted changes in dominant tree composition with a treatment of either the absence or presence of nonnative earthworms. We measured mass loss of each litter type and growth of a model nonnative plant species (Festuca arundinacea, fescue) sown into each mesocosm. Mass loss was greater for litter of tree species characterized by lower C:N ratios. Earthworms enhanced litter mass loss, but only for species with lower C:N, leading to a significant litter × earthworm interaction. Fescue biomass was significantly greater in treatments with litter of low C:N and greater mass loss, suggesting that rapid decomposition of forest litter may be more favorable to understory plant invasions. Earthworms were expected to enhance invasion by increasing mass loss and removing the physical barrier of litter. However, earthworms typically reduced invasion success but not under invasive tree litter where the presence of earthworms facilitated invasion success compared to other litter treatments where earthworms were present. We conclude that past and predicted future shifts in dominant tree species may influence forest understory invasibility. The presence of nonnative earthworms may either suppress of facilitate invasibility depending on the species of dominant overstory tree species and the litter layers they produce.","['Jones', 'Belote']",10.1007/s10530-008-9315-1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/67de47d8127c1a788aa6b116c99b7f32bea36a0c,0,0,Tree leaf litter composition and nonnative earthworms influence plant invasion in experimental forest floor mosocosms,Biological Invasions,,['Biology'],Motor Control

"Aquatic macrophytes play an important role in the survival and proliferation of invertebrates in freshwater ecosystems. Epiphytic invertebrate communities may be altered through the replacement of native macrophytes by exotic macrophytes, even when the macrophytes are close relatives and have similar morphology. We sampled an invasive exotic macrophyte, Eurasian watermilfoil ( Myriophyllum spicatum ), and native milfoils Myriophyllum sibericum and Myriophyllum alterniflorum in four bodies of water in southern Quebec and upstate New York during the summer of 2005. Within each waterbody, we compared the abundance, diversity, and community composition of epiphytic macroinvertebrates on exotic and native Myriophyllum. In general, both M. sibericum and M. alterniflorum had higher invertebrate diversity and higher invertebrate biomass and supported more gastropods than the exotic M. spicatum. In late summer, invertebrate density tended to be higher on M. sibericum than on M. spicatum, but lower on M. alterniflorum than on M. spicatum. Our results demonstrate that M. spicatum supports macroinvertebrate communities that may differ from those on structurally similar native macrophytes, although these differences vary across sites and sampling dates. Thus, the replacement of native milfoils by M. spicatum may have indirect effects on aquatic food webs.","['Ricciardi', 'Wilson']",10.1139/f08-187,http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f08-187,0,0,Epiphytic macroinvertebrate communities on Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) and native milfoils Myriophyllum sibericum and Myriophyllum alterniflorum in eastern North America,['Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences'],"(['Aquatic Science', 'Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics'],)",,Motor Control

"This study examines the impact of the exotic nitrogen-fixing legume Melilotus officinalis (L.) Lam. on native and exotic species cover in two Great Plains ecosystems in Badlands National Park, South Dakota. Melilotus is still widely planted and its effects on native ecosystems are not well studied. Melilotus could have direct effects on native plants, such as through competition or facilitation. Alternatively, Melilotus may have indirect effects on natives, e.g., by favoring exotic species which in turn have a negative effect on native species. This study examined these interactions across a 4-year period in two contrasting vegetation types: Badlands sparse vegetation and western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii) mixed-grass prairie. Structural equation models were used to analyze the pathways through which Melilotus, native species, and other exotic species interact over a series of 2-year time steps. Melilotus can affect native and exotic species both in the current year and in the years after its death (a lag effect). A lag effect is possible because the death of a Melilotus plant can leave an open, potentially nitrogen-enriched site on the landscape. The results showed that the relationship between Melilotus and native and exotic species varied depending on the habitat and the year. In Badlands sparse vegetation, there was a consistent, strong, and positive relationship between Melilotus cover and native and exotic species cover suggesting that Melilotus is acting as a nurse plant and facilitating the growth of other species. In contrast, in western wheatgrass prairie, Melilotus was acting as a weak competitor and had no consistent effect on other species. In both habitats, there was little evidence for a direct lag effect of Melilotus on other species. Together, these results suggest both facilitative and competitive roles for Melilotus, depending on the vegetation type it invades.","['Larson', 'Van Riper']",10.1007/s11258-008-9438-6,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ef99c8257d99999fde50cd9c62d6c28a12d5441b,0,0,Role of invasive Melilotus officinalis in two native plant communities,Plant Ecology,,['Biology'],Motor Control

"1. With continued globalization, species are being transported and introduced into novel habitats at an accelerating rate. Interactions between invasive species may provide important mechanisms that moderate their impacts on native species. 2. The European green crab Carcinus maenas is an aggressive predator that was introduced to the east coast of North America in the mid-1800 s and is capable of rapid consumption of bivalve prey. A newer invasive predator, the Asian shore crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus, was first discovered on the Atlantic coast in the 1980s, and now inhabits many of the same regions as C. maenas within the Gulf of Maine. Using a series of field and laboratory investigations, we examined the consequences of interactions between these predators. 3. Density patterns of these two species at different spatial scales are consistent with negative interactions. As a result of these interactions, C. maenas alters its diet to consume fewer mussels, its preferred prey, in the presence of H. sanguineus. Decreased mussel consumption in turn leads to lower growth rates for C. maenas, with potential detrimental effects on C. maenas populations. 4. Rather than an invasional meltdown, this study demonstrates that, within the Gulf of Maine, this new invasive predator can moderate the impacts of the older invasive predator.","['J.C. Buck', 'T.

"We investigated habitat preferences of two invasive Ponto-Caspian gammarids (Dikerogammarus haemobaphes and Pontogammarus robustoides) and a native European species (Gammarus fossarum) in laboratory experiments.

Ten objects of the same type were glued to a plastic plate (10 × 10 cm) with methyl acrylic glue. The plates were placed in experimental tanks in various combinations. A single gammarid was put into the tank and its position was determined after 24 h. The studied species responded differently to the presence of zebra mussels. D. haemobaphes preferred living mussels rather than their empty shells and these two habitats over stones and empty plates. It responded positively to shell shape, selecting varnished shells rather than varnished stones, and to shell surface properties, selecting clean shells rather than varnished shells. It did not respond to waterborne mussel exudates. P. robustoides did not exhibit any preferences for the above-mentioned substrata. G. fossarum was attracted by empty mussel shells (but not by living mussels). It responded only to their shape, not to surface properties. The strong affinity for zebra mussels, exhibited by D. haemobaphes, might help it survive and develop stable populations in newly invaded areas.","['Zytkowicz', 'Kobak']",10.1007/s10750-007-0716-4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f5a9c80e4717ab69d2d1c6baa25aafbd64bcca1f,0,0,"Preferences of invasive Ponto-Caspian and native European gammarids for zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha, Bivalvia) shell habitat",Hydrobiologia,,['Biology'],Motor Control

"The Laurentian Great Lakes have been subject to numerous introductions of nonindigenous species, including two recent benthic fish invaders, Eurasian ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus) and round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus), as well as the benthic bivalve, zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). These three exotic species, or “exotic triad,” may impact nearshore benthic communities due to their locally high abundances and expanding distributions. Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine (1) whether ruffe and gobies may compete for habitat and invertebrate food in benthic environments, and (2) if zebra mussels can alter those competitive relationships by serving as an alternate food source for gobies. In laboratory mesocosms, both gobies and ruffe preferred cobble and macrophyte areas to open sand either when alone or in sympatry. In a 9-week goby–ruffe competition experiment simulating an invasion scenario with a limited food base, gobies grew faster than did ruffe, suggesting that gobies may be competitively superior at low resource levels. When zebra mussels were added in a short-term experiment, the presence or absence of mussels did not affect goby or ruffe growth, as few zebra mussels were consumed. This finding, along with other laboratory evidence, suggests that gobies may prefer soft-bodied invertebrate prey over zebra mussels. Studies of interactions among the “exotic triad”, combined with continued surveillance, may help Great Lakes fisheries managers to predict future population sizes and distributions of these invasive fish, evaluate their impacts on native food webs, and direct possible control measures to appropriate species.",Bauer et al ,10.1007/s10530-006-9067-8,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b5efcd4458ecb9d7c6c8d74255dc279a8eb273d8,0,0,"Predicting habitat use and trophic interactions of Eurasian ruffe, round gobies, and zebra mussels in nearshore areas of Great Lakes",Biological Invasions,,['Biology'],Motor Control
"Positive interactions play a widespread role in facilitating biological invasions. Here we use a landscape-scale ant exclusion experiment to show that widespread invasion of tropical rainforest by honeydew-producing scale insects on Christmas Island (Indian Ocean) has been facilitated by positive interactions with the invasive ant Anoplolepis gracilipes. Toxic bait was used to exclude A. gracilipes from large (9-35 ha) forest patches. Within 11 weeks, ant activity on the ground and on trunks had been reduced by 98-100%, while activity on control plots remained unchanged. The exclusion of ants caused a 100% decline in the density of scale insects in the canopies of three rainforest trees in 12 months (Inocarpus fagifer, Syzygium nervosum and Barringtonia racemosa), but on B. racemosa densities of scale insects also declined in control plots, resulting in no effect of ant exclusion on this species. This study demonstrates the role of positive interactions in facilitating biological invasions, and supports recent models calling for greater recognition of the role of positive interactions in structuring ecological communities.","['Green', 'Abbot']",10.1111/J.0030-1299.2007.15629.X,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7ffaf5eda39fd5c9b9b7a594aa29973ff200be76,0,0,Collapse of ant-scale mutualism in a rainforest on Christmas Island,,,['Biology'],Motor Control

"All but one of the nine non-native marine species that established populations in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (sGSL) in the past decade initially invaded the sGSL via coastal and estuarine waters of Prince Edward Island (PEI). Almost half of these species are tunicates, and all but one still occur only in PEI. Recent introductions include Styela clava Herdman in 1997, Botryllus schlosseri (Pallas) in 2001, Botrylloides violaceus Oka in 2002, and Ciona intestinalis (Linnaeus) in 2004. The goal of this paper was to investigate which characteristics of PEI estuaries may have resulted in their being more susceptible to tunicate invasions than estuaries elsewhere in the sGSL. At least one genus that recently established viable populations in PEI was previously introduced to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, apparently without establishing permanent populations. This implies that either propagule pressure has increased or environmental factors are more conducive to establishment now than they were previously. The fluctuating resource availability model predicts increased invasibility of environments that experience pulses of resources such as space or nutrients. Intense development of both agriculture and aquaculture in PEI, and high population density compared to other areas of the sGSL, are associated with high and fluctuating estuarine nutrient levels and a large surface area of artificial substrates (mussel socks) that is kept relatively free of competitors, and is replaced regularly. Changes in nutrient loading and the development of aquaculture have also occurred within the past two to three decades. The provision of artificial structure is likely a critical factor in the successful establishment of tunicates in PEI, because natural hard substrates are scarce. Facilitation by green crabs (Carcinus maenas L.) may be a contributing factor in the spread of Styela. Only one estuary lacking green crabs has an established population of Styela, and at least two known inoculations of Styela into estuaries without green crabs have failed. A likely mechanism for facilitation is the consumption by green crab of the snail Astyris lunata, a known Styela predator.",Locke et al,10.1016/J.JEMBE.2006.10.016,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8f51b9b6078e92f37fcda158ac3318f03266d3b7,0,0,Invasion of the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence by the clubbed tunicate (Styela clava Herdman): Potential mechanisms for invasions of Prince Edward Island estuaries,,,['Biology'],Motor Control
"Summary   1 Plant species invading nutrient-poor ecosystems are likely to have their greatest impact on the native plant community by competing for resources below-ground. We investigated how root competition by an invasive tree, Cinnamomum verum, affects regeneration in nutrient-poor tropical secondary forests, in the Seychelles.  2 We performed three trenching experiments to investigate the effects of severing the root systems of mature trees on the growth of juveniles. These experiments had the following objectives: (i) to compare the responses of native and invasive saplings to release from root competition; (ii) to compare how seedlings (  50 cm tall) of C. verum respond to trenching; and (iii) to compare the response of C. verum seedlings to trenching in forest stands with and without C. verum as the dominant species.  3 The results indicate that the dense topsoil root mat produced by mature C. verum trees suppresses the growth of young trees, mainly by increasing competition for scarce nutrients. Growth responses to trenching were stronger for seedlings than saplings, and stronger for juveniles of invasive than of native species. We conclude that stands of C. verum exert a strong below-ground filtering effect on seedling regeneration. This effect is likely to influence secondary forest succession by selectively reducing the establishment of invasive and small-seeded species.  4 Because of the bias in invasion biology towards relatively nutrient-rich, productive ecosystems, few studies have investigated the role of below-ground resource competition in plant invasions. Our results for an infertile, phosphorus-poor ecosystem show that root competition by an alien species can exert a strong influence on forest regeneration. We suggest that this mechanism may be of general importance in nutrient-poor tropical forests invaded by alien tree species.",Kueffer et al,10.1111/J.1365-2745.2007.01213.X,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0c728a828766f81d9fdd7d073be5f49e2e7e78d9,0,0,Strong below-ground competition shapes tree regeneration in invasive Cinnamomum verum forests,,,['Biology'],Motor Control
"Theory predicts that damage by a shared herbivore to a secondary host plant species may either be higher or lower in the vicinity of a preferred host plant species. To evaluate the importance of ecological factors, such as host plant proximity and density, in determining the direction and strength of such herbivore-mediated indirect effects, we quantified oviposition by the exotic weevil Rhinocyllus conicus on the native wavyleaf thistle Cirsium undulatum in midgrass prairie on loam soils in the upper Great Plains, USA. Over three years (2001-2003), the number of eggs laid by R. conicus on C. undulatum always decreased significantly with distance (0-220 m) from a musk thistle (Carduus nutans L.) patch. Neither the level of R. conicus oviposition on C. undulatum nor the strength of the distance effect was predicted by local musk thistle patch density or by local C. undulatum density (<5 m). The results suggest that high R. conicus egg loads on C. undulatum near musk thistle resulted from the native thistle's co-occurrence with the coevolved preferred exotic host plant and not from the weevil's response to local host plant density. Mean egg loads on C. undulatum also were greater at sites with higher R. conicus densities. We conclude that both preferred-plant proximity and shared herbivore density strongly affected the herbivore-mediated indirect interaction, suggesting that such interactions are important pathways by which invasive exotic weeds can indirectly impact native plants.",Russel et al,10.1890/0012-9658(2007)88[413:VIHIEO]2.0.CO;2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0bd5d1d53fbb3fc9c7aa5327779a7c64ff293eac,0,0,Variation in herbivore-mediated indirect effects of an invasive plant on a native plant,Ecology,,"['Biology', 'Medicine']",Motor Control
"Negative interactions between non-indigenous and native species has been an important research topic of invasion biology. However, interactions between two or more invasive species may be as important in understanding biological invasions, but they have rarely been studied. In this paper, we describe three field experiments that investigated interactions between two non-indigenous plant species invasive in the eastern United States, Lonicera japonica (a perennial vine) and Microstegium vimineum (an annual grass). A press removal experiment conducted within a deciduous forest understory community indicated that M. vimineum was a superior competitor to L. japonica. We tested the hypothesis that the competitive success of M. vimineum was because it overgrew, and reduced light available to, L. japonica, by conducting a separate light gradient experiment within the same community. Shade cloth that simulated the M. vimineum canopy reduced the performance of L. japonica. In a third complementary experiment, we added experimental support hosts to test the hypothesis that the competitive ability of L. japonica is limited by support hosts, onto which L. japonica climbs to access light. We found that the abundance of climbing branches increased with the number of support hosts. Results of this experiment indicate that these two invasive species compete asymmetrically for resources, particularly light.","['J.F.

"Biological invasions are a growing aspect of global biodiversity change. In many regions, introduced species richness increases supralinearly over time. This does not, however, necessarily indicate increasing introduction rates or invasion success. We develop a simple null model to identify the expected trend in invasion records over time. For constant introduction rates and success, the expected trend is exponentially increasing. Model extensions with varying introduction rate and success can also generate exponential distributions. We then analyse temporal trends in aquatic, marine and terrestrial invasion records. Most data sets support an exponential distribution (15/16) and the null invasion model (12/16). Thus, our model shows that no change in introduction rate or success need be invoked to explain the majority of observed trends. Further, an exponential trend does not necessarily indicate increasing invasion success or 'invasional meltdown', and a saturating trend does not necessarily indicate decreasing success or biotic resistance.","['Pachepsky E.', 'Wonham M.J.']",10.1111/J.1461-0248.2006.00913.X,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/79726ebe036449211e3f083cebe384bee8cf5e43,0,0,A null model of temporal trends in biological invasion records,Ecology letters,,"['Biology', 'Medicine']",Motor Control
"Robinia pseudoacacia, a nitrogen-fixing, clonal tree species native to the central Appalachian and Ozark Mountains, is considered to be one of the top 100 worldwide woody plant invaders. We initiated this project to determine the impact of black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) on an upland coastal ecosystem and to estimate the spread of this species within Cape Cod National Seashore (CCNS). We censused 20 × 20 m plots for vegetation cover and environmental characteristics in the center of twenty randomly-selected Robinia pseudoacacia stands. Additionally, paired plots were surveyed under native overstory stands, comprised largely of pitch pine (Pinus rigida) and mixed pitch pine–oak (Quercus velutina and Quercus alba) communities. These native stands were located 20 m from the edge of the sampled locust stand and had similar land use histories. To determine the historical distribution of black locust in CCNS, we digitized and georeferenced historical and current aerial photographs of randomly-selected stands. Ordination analyses revealed striking community-level differences between locust and pine–oak stands in their immediate vicinity. Understory nonnative species richness and abundance values were significantly higher under Robinia stands than under the paired native stands. Additionally, animal-dispersed plant species tended to occur in closer stands, suggesting their spread between locust stands. Robinia stand area significantly decreased from the 1970’s to 2002, prompting us to recommend no management action of black locust and a monitoring program and possible removal of associated animal-dispersed species.

"Summary   1 Alien species may form plant–animal mutualistic complexes that contribute to their invasive potential. Using multivariate techniques, we examined the structure of a plant–pollinator web comprising both alien and native plants and flower visitors in the temperate forests of north-west Patagonia, Argentina. Our main objective was to assess whether plant species origin (alien or native) influences the composition of flower visitor assemblages. We also examined the influence of other potential confounding intrinsic factors such as flower symmetry and colour, and extrinsic factors such as flowering time, site and habitat disturbance.  2 Flowers of alien and native plant species were visited by a similar number of species and proportion of insects from different orders, but the composition of the assemblages of flower-visiting species differed between alien and native plants.  3 The influence of plant species origin on the composition of flower visitor assemblages persisted after accounting for other significant factors such as flowering time, bearing red corollas, and habitat disturbance. This influence was at least in part determined by the fact that alien flower visitors were more closely associated with alien plants than with native plants. The main native flower visitors were, on average, equally associated with native and alien plant species.  4 In spite of representing a minor fraction of total species richness (3.6% of all species), alien flower visitors accounted for > 20% of all individuals recorded on flowers. Thus, their high abundance could have a significant impact in terms of pollination.  5 The mutualistic web of alien plants and flower-visiting insects is well integrated into the overall community-wide pollination web. However, in addition to their use of the native biota, invasive plants and flower visitors may benefit from differential interactions with their alien partners. The existence of these invader complexes could contribute to the spread of aliens into novel environments.","['Aizen', 'Morales']",10.1111/J.1365-2745.2005.01069.X,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/35670c779047470300bdd9dc90c2a605955abc51,0,0,"Invasive mutualisms and the structure of plant-pollinator interactions in the temperate forests of north-west Patagonia, Argentina",,,['Biology'],Motor Control

"Many studies have shown that plant or bird invasions can be facilitated by native species, but few have demonstrated the possibility of a positive interaction between introduced species. We analysed the relationships between four invasive alien fleshy-fruited plants, Clidemia hirta, Rubus alceifolius, Lantana camara, Schinus terebinthifolius, and an invasive alien bird, the red-whiskered bulbul Pycnonotus jocosus introduced to Reunion Island (Indian Ocean). We compared the distribution of food items in the bulbul diet according to seasons and to abundance classes of this bird. Pycnonotus jocosus is mostly frugivorous and frequently eats the main alien plants (more than 80% frequency of food items). Sites with alien species, such as Clidemia hirta, providing fruits throughout the year supported more birds than sites providing fruits, such as Schinus terebinthifolius, seasonally. The birds facilitated seed germination by removing the pulp of fruit: the final per cent germination (FG) of cleaned seeds was higher than those within the fruit for three of the four plant species and in some cases passage through birds significantly increased FG (Schinus terebinthifolius) or Coefficient of Velocity (CV) (Lantana camara).",Mandon-Dalger et al,10.1017/s0266467404001774,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0266467404001774,0,0,Relationship betwen alien plants and na alien bird species on Reunion island,['Journal of Tropical Ecology'],"(['Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics'],)",,Motor Control

"Landscape change has great, yet infrequently measured, potential to influence the susceptibility of natural systems to invasive species impacts. We quantified attack by an invasive biological control weevil (Rhinocyllus conicus) on native thistles in relation to two types of landscape change: agricultural intensification and invasion by an exotic thistle, Carduus nutans, the original target of biological control. Weevil egg load was measured on native thistles in three landscape types: (1) agriculture dominated, (2) grassland dominated with exotic thistles, and, (3) grassland dominated without exotic thistles. We found no difference in egg load on native thistles within grassland landscapes without exotic thistles vs. within agricultural landscapes, suggesting that agricultural intensification per se does not influence levels of weevil attack. However, attack on the native Cirsium undulatum increased significantly (three- to fivefold) with increasing exotic thistle density. Within-patch exotic thistle density explained >50% of the variation in both the intensity and frequency of weevil attack. Since R. conicus feeding dramatically reduces seed production, exotic thistles likely exert a negative indirect effect on native thistles.

"Positive interactions among non-native species could greatly exacerbate the problem of invasions, but are poorly studied and our knowledge of their occurrence is mostly limited to plant-pollinator and dispersal interactions. We found that invasion of bullfrogs is facilitated by the presence of co-evolved non-native fish, which increase tadpole survival by reducing predatory macroinvertebrate densities. Native dragonfly nymphs in Oregon, USA caused zero survival of bullfrog tadpoles in a replicated field experiment unless a non-native sunfish was present to reduce dragonfly density. This pattern was also evident in pond surveys where the best predictors of bullfrog abundance were the presence of non-native fish and bathymetry. This is the first experimental evidence of facilitation between two non-native vertebrates and supports the invasional meltdown hypothesis. Such positive interactions among non-native species have the potential to disrupt ecosystems by amplifying invasions, and our study shows they can occur via indirect mechanisms.","['R.B. Bury', 'C.A.

"Factors such as aggressiveness and adaptation to disturbed environments have been suggested as important characteristics of invasive ant species, but diet has rarely been considered. However, because invasive ants reach extraordinary densities at introduced locations, increased feeding efficiency or increased exploitation of new foods should be important in their success. Earlier studies suggest that honeydew produced by Homoptera (e.g., aphids, mealybugs, scale insects) may be important in the diet of the invasive ant species Solenopsis invicta. To determine if this is the case, we studied associations of S. invicta and Homoptera in east Texas and conducted a regional survey for such associations throughout the species' range in the southeast United States. In east Texas, we found that S. invicta tended Ho- moptera extensively and actively constructed shelters around them. The shelters housed a variety of Homoptera whose frequency differed according to either site location or season, presumably because of differences in host plant availability and temperature. Overall, we estimate that the honeydew produced in Homoptera shelters at study sites in east Texas could supply nearly one-half of the daily energetic requirements of an S. invicta colony. Of that, 70% may come from a single species of invasive Homoptera, the mealybugAntonina graminis. Homoptera shelters were also common at regional survey sites and A. graminis occurred in shelters at nine of 11 survey sites. A comparison of shelter densities at survey sites and in east Texas suggests that our results from east Texas could apply throughout the range of S. invicta in the southeast United States. Antonina graminis may be an ex- ceptionally important nutritional resource for S. invicta in the southeast United States. While it remains largely unstudied, the tending of introduced or invasive Homoptera also appears important to other, and perhaps all, invasive ant species. Exploitative or mutually beneficial associations that occur between these insects may be an important, previously unrecognized factor promoting their success.","['S.B.

"Although many studies have documented the impact of invasive species on indigenous flora and fauna, few have rigorously examined interactions among invaders and the potential for one exotic species to replace another. European green crabs (Carcinus maenas), once common in rocky intertidal habitats of southern New England, have recently declined in abundance coincident with the invasion of the Asian shore crab (Hemigrapsus sanguineus). Over a four-year period in the late 1990s we documented a significant (40- 90%) decline in green crab abundance and a sharp (10-fold) increase in H. sanguineus at three sites in southern New England. Small, newly recruited green crabs had a significant risk of predation when paired with larger H. sanguineus in the laboratory, and recruitment of 0-yr C. maenas was reduced by H. sanguineus as well as by larger conspecifics in field- deployed cages (via predation and cannibalism, respectively). In contrast, recruitment of 0-yr H. sanguineus was not affected by larger individuals of either crab species during the same experiments. The differential susceptibility of C. maenas and H. sanguineus recruits to predation and cannibalism likely contributed to the observed decrease in C. maenas abundance and the almost exponential increase in H. sanguineus abundance during the period of study, While the Asian shore crab is primarily restricted to rocky intertidal habitats, C. maenas is found intertidally, subtidally, and in a range of substrate types in New England. Thus, the apparent replacement of C. maenas by H. sanguineus in rocky intertidal habitats of southern New England may not ameliorate the economic and ecological impacts attributed to green crab populations in other habitats of this region. For example, field experiments indicate that predation pressure on a native bivalve species (Mytilus edulis) has not nec- essarily decreased with the declines of C. maenas. While H. sanguineus has weaker per capita effects than C. maenas, its densities greatly exceed those of C. maenas at present and its population-level effects are likely comparable to the past effects of C. maenas. The Carcinus-Hemigrapsus interactions documented here are relevant in other parts of the world where green crabs and grapsid crabs interact, particularly on the west coast of North America where C. maenas has recently invaded and co-occurs with two native Hemigrapsus species.","['Whitlatch R.B', 'Lohrer A:M.']",10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[0719:IAAARO]2.0.CO;2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/79f62659fe8e588ce694c5c1a6b2770b6ded841c,0,0,Interactions among aliens: apparent replacement of one exotic species by another,,,['Biology'],Motor Control
"We examined the role of nonnative honey bees (Apis mellifera) as pollinators of the invasive, nonnative plant species yellow star-thistle (Centaurea solstitialis), both introduced to the western United States in the early to middle 1800s. Using four different treatments (three exclosure types) at flower heads, we observed visitation rates of different pollinators. Honey bees were the most common visitors at each of three transects established at three study locales in California: University of California at Davis, Cosumnes River Preserve, and Santa Cruz Island. A significant correlation existed between honey bee visitation levels monitored in all these transects and the average number of viable seeds per seed head for the same transects. Selective exclusion of honey bees at flower heads using a 3 mm diameter mesh significantly reduced seed set per seed head at all locales. Seed set depression was less dramatic at the island locale because of high visitation rates by generalist halictid bees Augochlorella ...","['A.M. Wenner', 'R.W. Thorp', 'J.M.

"Biological invasions as drivers of biodiversity loss have recently been challenged. Fundamentally, we must know where species that are threatened by invasive alien species (IAS) live, and the degree to which they are threatened. We report the first study linking 1372 vertebrates threatened by more than 200 IAS from the completely revised Global Invasive Species Database. New maps of the vulnerability of threatened vertebrates to IAS permit assessments of whether IAS have a major influence on biodiversity, and if so, which taxonomic groups are threatened and where they are threatened. We found that centres of IAS-threatened vertebrates are concentrated in the Americas, India, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand. The areas in which IAS-threatened species are located do not fully match the current hotspots of invasions, or the current hotspots of threatened species. The relative importance of biological invasions as drivers of biodiversity loss clearly varies across regions and taxa, and changes over time, with mammals from India, Indonesia, Australia and Europe are increasingly being threatened by IAS. The chytrid fungus primarily threatens amphibians, whereas invasive mammals primarily threaten other vertebrates. The differences in IAS threats between regions and taxa can help efficiently target IAS, which is essential for achieving the Strategic Plan 2020 of the Convention on Biological Diversity.","['Jeschke J.M.', 'Genovesi P.', 'Bellard C.']",10.1098/rspb.2015.2454,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2015.2454,0,0,Global patterns in threats to vertebrates by biological invasions,['Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences'],"(['General Agricultural and Biological Sciences', 'General Environmental Science', 'General Immunology and Microbiology', 'General Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology', 'General Medicine'],)",,Motor Control

"Before European settlement, grassy white box woodlands were the dominant vegetation in the east of thewheat-sheep belt of south-eastern Australia. Tree clearing, cultivation and pasture improvement have ledto fragmentation of this once relatively continuous ecosystem, leaving a series of remnants whichthemselves have been modified by livestock grazing. Little-modified remnants are extremely rare. Weexamined and compared the effects of fragmentation and disturbance on the understorey flora ofwoodland remnants, through a survey of remnants of varying size, grazing history and tree clearing. Inaccordance with fragmentation theory, species richness generally increased with remnant size, and, forlittle-grazed remnants, smaller remnants were more vulnerable to weed invasion. Similarly, treeclearing and grazing encouraged weed invasion and reduced native species richness. Evidence forincreased total species richness at intermediate grazing levels, as predicted by the intermediatedisturbance hypothesis, was equivocal. Remnant quality was more severely affected by grazing than byremnant size. All little-grazed remnants had lower exotic species abundance and similar or higher nativespecies richness than grazed remnants, despite their extremely small sizes (&lt; 6 ha). Further, small, littlegrazedremnants maintained the general character of the pre-European woodland understorey, whilegrazing caused changes to the dominant species. Although generally small, the little-grazed remnantsare the best representatives of the pre-European woodland understorey, and should be central to anyconservation plan for the woodlands. Selected larger remnants are needed to complement these,however, to increase the total area of woodland conserved, and, because most little-grazed remnants arecleared, to represent the ecosystem in its original structural form. For the maintenance of native plantdiversity and composition in little-grazed remnants, it is critical that livestock grazing continues to beexcluded. For grazed remnants, maintenance of a site in its current state would allow continuation ofpast management, while restoration to a pre-European condition would require management directedtowards weed removal, and could take advantage of the difference noted in the predominant life-cycleof native (perennial) versus exotic (annual or biennial) species.","['Thiele KR', 'Prober SM']",10.1071/bt9950349,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/bt9950349,1,2000,Conservation of the Grassy White Box Woodlands: Relative Contributions of Size and Disturbance to Floristic Composition and Diversity of Remnants,['Australian Journal of Botany'],"(['Plant Science', 'Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics'],)",,Motor Control

"What roles do ruderals and residuals play in early forest succession and how does repeated disturbance affect them? We examined this question by monitoring plant cover and composition on a productive site for 6 years after clearcutting and planting Douglas-fir ( Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco). The replicated experiment included three treatments: vegetation control with five annual herbicide applications superimposed over two levels of slash removal (bole only or total tree plus most other wood) and an untreated control. Three species groups were analyzed: native forest, native ruderals, and exotic ruderals. Without vegetation control, the understory was rapidly invaded by exotic ruderals but was codominated by native and exotic ruderals by year 6. Douglas-fir cover surpassed covers in the three species group covers at least 3 years sooner with herbicide treatments than without. Species richness and coverage were lower for all species groups with vegetation control than without vegetation control. The effects of organic matter removal were much less than that of vegetation control. As predicted by the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis, repeated vegetation control resulted in declining cover and richness; however, native forest species were surprisingly resilient, maintaining as much or more cover and richness as the ruderal groups.","['Harrington C.', 'Peter D.

"Context. Wildfire is a major driver of the structure and function of mallee eucalypt- and spinifex-dominated landscapes. Understanding how fire influences the distribution of biota in these fire-prone environments is essential for effective ecological and conservation-based management.Aims. We aimed to (1) determine the effects of an extensive wildfire (118 000 ha) on a small mammal community in the mallee shrublands of semiarid Australia and (2) assess the hypothesis that the fire-response patterns of small mammals can be predicted by their life-history characteristics.Methods. Small-mammal surveys were undertaken concurrently at 26 sites: once before the fire and on four occasions following the fire (including 14 sites that remained unburnt). We documented changes in small-mammal occurrence before and after the fire, and compared burnt and unburnt sites. In addition, key components of vegetation structure were assessed at each site.Key results. Wildfire had a strong influence on vegetation structure and on the occurrence of small mammals. The mallee ningaui, Ningaui yvonneae, a dasyurid marsupial, showed a marked decline in the immediate post-fire environment, corresponding with a reduction in hummock-grass cover in recently burnt vegetation. Species richness of native small mammals was positively associated with unburnt vegetation, although some species showed no clear response to wildfire.Conclusions. Our results are consistent with the contention that mammal responses to fire are associated with their known life-history traits. The species most strongly affected by wildfire, N. yvonneae, has the most specific habitat requirements and restricted life history of the small mammals in the study area. The only species positively associated with recently burnt vegetation, the introduced house mouse, Mus domesticus, has a flexible life history and non-specialised resource requirements.Implications. Maintaining sources for recolonisation after large-scale wildfires will be vital to the conservation of native small mammals in mallee ecosystems.",Kelly L.T. et al.,10.1071/wr10016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/wr10016,1,2000,"The short-term responses of small mammals to wildfire in semiarid mallee shrubland, Australia",['Wildlife Research'],"(['Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics'],)",,Motor Control

"Prescribed fires are important for rangeland restoration and affect plant community composition and species interactions. Many rangeland plant communities have been, or are under the threat of noxious weed invasion, however there is little information on how fire effects weeds. Our objective was to determine the effects of prescribed rangeland fire on dalmatian toadflax [Linaria dalmatica (L.) Miller] density, cover, biomass, and seed production. These plant characteristics, as well as density, cover, and biomass of perennial grasses and forbs were measured within burned and adjacent not-burned areas on 3 Artemisia tridentata/Agropyron spicatum habitat types in Montana. Areas were burned in the spring and measured in the fall 1999. Comparisons of plant characteristics between the burned and not-burned sites were made using t-tests and non-parametric Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests. After 1 growing season, fire did not affect density or cover of dalmatian toadflax. Burning increased dalmatian toadflax bio- mass per square meter at 2 sites, and per plant biomass at all 3 sites. Seed production of dalmatian toadflax was increased by fire at all 3 sites. Fire reduced forb cover at 1 site and increased grass biomass at 2 sites. The increases in dalmatian toadflax biomass and seed production suggest that fire used to restore healthy plant communities may increase dalmatian toadflax dominance. We recommend weed management procedures, such as herbicide control and seeding desirable species, be integrated with prescribed fire where dalmatian toadflax is present in the plant community.","['Sheley R.L.', 'Jacobs J.

". Changes in disturbance due to fire regime in southwestern Pinus ponderosa forests over the last century have led to dense forests that are threatened by widespread fire. It has been shown in other studies that a pulse of native, early-seral opportunistic species typically follow such disturbance events. With the growing importance of exotic plants in local flora, however, these exotics often fill this opportunistic role in recovery. We report the effects of fire severity on exotic plant species following three widespread fires of 1996 in northern Arizona P. ponderosa forests. Species richness and abundance of all vascular plant species, including exotics, were higher in burned than nearby unburned areas. Exotic species were far more important, in terms of cover, where fire severity was highest. Species present after wildfires include those of the pre-disturbed forest and new species that could not be predicted from above-ground flora of nearby unburned forests.",Crawford J.S. et al.,10.2307/3236610,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d4c14926aecf41925f7933246adfcdadbc1c75ca,1,2000,Responses of exotic plant species to fires in Pinus ponderosa forests in northern Arizona,,,['Geography'],Motor Control

"The eastern Mediterranean is a hotspot of biological invasions. Numerous species of Indo-pacific origin have colonized the Mediterranean in recent times, including tropical symbiont-bearing foraminifera. Among these is the species Pararotalia calcariformata. Unlike other invasive foraminifera, this species was discovered only two decades ago and is restricted to the eastern Mediterranean coast. Combining ecological, genetic and physiological observations, we attempt to explain the recent invasion of this species in the Mediterranean Sea. Using morphological and genetic data, we confirm the species attribution to P. calcariformata McCulloch 1977 and identify its symbionts as a consortium of diatom species dominated by Minutocellus polymorphus. We document photosynthetic activity of its endosymbionts using Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorometry and test the effects of elevated temperatures on growth rates of asexual offspring. The culturing of asexual offspring for 120 days shows a 30-day period of rapid growth followed by a period of slower growth. A subsequent 48-day temperature sensitivity experiment indicates a similar developmental pathway and high growth rate at 28°C, whereas an almost complete inhibition of growth was observed at 20°C and 35°C. This indicates that the offspring of this species may have lower tolerance to cold temperatures than what would be expected for species native to the Mediterranean. We expand this hypothesis by applying a Species Distribution Model (SDM) based on modern occurrences in the Mediterranean using three environmental variables: irradiance, turbidity and yearly minimum temperature. The model reproduces the observed restricted distribution and indicates that the range of the species will drastically expand westwards under future global change scenarios. We conclude that P. calcariformata established a population in the Levant because of the recent warming in the region. In line with observations from other groups of organisms, our results indicate that continued warming of the eastern Mediterranean will facilitate the invasion of more tropical marine taxa into the Mediterranean, disturbing local biodiversity and ecosystem structure.",Schmidt C et al.,10.1371/journal.pone.0132917,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7cfca432187be33047220364767a2ba6009e5859,1,2000,Recent Invasion of the Symbiont-Bearing Foraminifera Pararotalia into the Eastern Mediterranean Facilitated by the Ongoing Warming Trend ,PloS one,,"['Biology', 'Medicine']",Motor Control

"communities by alien plant species that can adversely affect community structure and function. To determine how corridor establishment influences riparian vegetation of the Allegheny High Plateau of northwestern Pennsylvania, we compared the species composition and richness of the herbaceous layer (all vascular plants s 1 m tall) of utility corridors and adjacent headwater riparian forests, and tested the hypothesis that utility corridors serve as foci for the invasion of adjacent riparian forest by alien vascular plants. We contrasted plant species richness and vegetative cover, cover by growth form, species richness and cover of alien plants and cover of microhabitat components (open soil, rock, leaf litter, log, bryophyte) in utility corridors and adjacent riparian forest at 17 sites. Cluster analysis revealed that herbaceous layer species assemblages in corridors and riparian forest were compositionally distinct. Herbaceous layer cover and species richness were significantly (P s 0.05) greater in corridors than in riparian forest. Fern, graminoid, and forb species co-dominated herbaceous layer cover in corridors; fern cover dominated riparian forests. Cover of alien plants was significantly greater in corridors than in riparian forest. Alien plant species richness and cover were significantly and positively correlated with open soil, floodplain width, and active channel width in corridors but were significantly and negatively correlated with litter cover in riparian forest. Given that the majority of alien plant species we found in corridors were shade-intolerant and absent from riparian forests, we conclude that open utility corridors primarily serve as habitat refugia, rather than as invasion foci, for alien plant species in riparian forests of the Allegheny High Plateau.","['Moriarity W.', 'Williams C.', 'Rubino D.']",10.2307/3088726,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d8683b22772f8f854e82f127cd3254f52d056db7,1,2000,Herbaceous layer contrast and alien plant occurrence in utility corridors and riparian forests of the Allegheny High Plateau ,,,['Biology'],Motor Control

"What roles do ruderals and residuals play in early forest succession and how does repeated disturbance affect them? We examined this question by monitoring plant cover and composition on a productive site for 6 years after clearcutting and planting Douglas-fir ( Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco). The replicated experiment included three treatments: vegetation control with five annual herbicide applications superimposed over two levels of slash removal (bole only or total tree plus most other wood) and an untreated control. Three species groups were analyzed: native forest, native ruderals, and exotic ruderals. Without vegetation control, the understory was rapidly invaded by exotic ruderals but was codominated by native and exotic ruderals by year 6. Douglas-fir cover surpassed covers in the three species group covers at least 3 years sooner with herbicide treatments than without. Species richness and coverage were lower for all species groups with vegetation control than without vegetation control. The effects of organic matter removal were much less than that of vegetation control. As predicted by the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis, repeated vegetation control resulted in declining cover and richness; however, native forest species were surprisingly resilient, maintaining as much or more cover and richness as the ruderal groups.","['Harrington C.', 'Peter D.

":  Grazing by large herbivores has the potential to facilitate invasion of natural grasslands by non-native plant species. Often, both herbivore identity and plant community type modulate this effect. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of grazing on non-native plant species richness and cover in montane grasslands of central Argentina as related to herbivore identity (horse or cattle) and plant community type. The study was conducted in piedmont valleys of the Ventania Mountains. The area is occupied by two major types of plant communities: short-needlegrass and tall-tussock grasslands. Short-needlegrass grasslands occupy poor soils and have higher plant species diversity compared to tall-tussock grasslands which typically grow on rich soils. Part of the study area is devoted to cattle husbandry, part is inhabited by feral horses, and part has been free of grazing by large herbivores for the last 15 years. We compared non-native species richness and cover at three levels of grazing (horse grazing, cattle grazing, grazing exclusion) and two levels of plant community type (short-needlegrass grassland and tall-tussock grassland) at the end of the growing season in 2006 and 2007. Thirty-one nonnative plant species were found growing in the study area. Grazing increased non-native species richness and cover and was highest under horse grazing and in communities on resource-rich soils. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that grazing by large non-native herbivores can facilitate non-native plant species invasion of natural grasslands. They also suggest that herbivore identity and community type modulate the effect of large herbivore grazing on grassland invasion by non-native plant species.","['Zalba S.', 'Distel R.', 'Loydi A.']",10.3375/043.030.0203,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/60802f41e7b06371f438edc5a17d72097b2270e6,1,2000,Large Herbivore Grazing and Non-native Plant Invasions in Montane Grasslands of Central Argentina,,,['Biology'],Motor Control

"Although individual ecosystems vary greatly in the degree to which they have been invaded by exotic species, it has remained difficult to isolate mechanisms influencing invader success. One largely anecdotal observation is that polluted or degraded areas will accumulate more invaders than less-impacted sites. However, the role of abiotic factors alone in influencing invisibility has been difficult to isolate, often because the supply of potential invaders is confounded with conditions thought to increase vulnerability to invasion. Here, we conducted a field experiment to test how the assemblages of exotic versus native marine invertebrates changed during community assembly under different exposure levels of a common pollutant, copper. The experiment was conducted by deploying fouling panels in a Randomized Block Design in San Francisco Bay. Panels were periodically removed, placed into buckets with differing copper concentrations, and returned to the field after 3 days. This design allowed propagule availability to the plates to be statistically independent of short-term copper exposure. The results demonstrate that copper caused significant differences in community structure. Average native species richness was significantly affected by copper exposure, but average exotic richness was not. The total native species pool within treatments exhibited a greater than 40% decline within increasing copper, while the exotic species pool did not change significantly. These results confirm that anthropogenic alteration of abiotic factors influences invader success, indicating that management strategies to reduce invader impacts should include both efforts to improve environmental conditions as well as reduce invader supply.",Crooks J. et al.,10.1007/s10530-010-9799-3,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/67be43ccf53eed74002f831d9adf2e4d99935a5a,1,2000,Aquatic pollution increases the relative success of invasive species,Biological Invasions,,['Biology'],Motor Control

"Semiarid ecosystems such as grasslands are characterized by high temporal variability in abiotic factors, which has led to suggestions that management actions may be more effective in some years than others. Here we examine this hypothesis in the context of grassland restoration, which faces two major obstacles: the contingency of native grass establishment on unpredictable precipitation, and competition from introduced species. We established replicated restoration experiments over three years at two sites in the northern Great Plains in order to examine the extent to which the success of several restoration strategies varied between sites and among years. We worked in 50-yr-old stands of crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum), an introduced perennial grass that has been planted on >10 × 106 ha in western North America. Establishment of native grasses was highly contingent on local conditions, varying fourfold among years and threefold between sites. Survivorship also varied greatly and increased signi...","['et al.', 'Christian JM', 'Wilson SD', 'Bakker JD']",10.1890/1051-0761(2003)013[0137:COGROY]2.0.CO;2,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6d0e92ca8c49acff6589dfe850e252b9d7b497d0,1,2000,"Contingency of grassland restoration on year, site, and competition from introduced grasses ",,,['Geography'],Motor Control

"Introductions of non-indigenous species have resulted in many ecological problems including the reduction of biodiversity, decline of commercially important species and alteration of ecosystems. The link between disturbance and invasion potential has rarely been studied in the marine environment where dominance hierarchies, dynamics of larval supply, and resource acquisition may differ greatly from terrestrial systems. In this study, hard substrate marine communities in Long Island Sound, USA were used to assess the effect of disturbance on resident species and recent invaders, ascidian growth form (i.e. colonial and solitary growth form), and the dominant species-specific responses within the community. Community age was an additional factor considered through manipulation of 5-wk old assemblages and 1-yr old assemblages. Disturbance treatments, exposing primary substrate, were characterized by frequency (single, biweekly, monthly) and magnitude (20%, 48%, 80%) of disturbance. In communities of different ages, disturbance frequency had a significant positive effect on space occupation of recent invaders and a significant negative effect on resident species. In the 5-wk community, magnitude of disturbance also had a significant effect. Disturbance also had a significant effect on ascidian growth form; colonial species occupied more primary space than controls in response to increased disturbance frequency and magnitude. In contrast, solitary species occupied significantly less space than controls. Species-specific responses were similar regardless of community age. The non-native colonial ascidian Diplosoma listerianum responded positively to increased disturbance frequency and magnitude, and occupied more primary space in treatments than in controls. The resident solitary ascidian Molgula manhattensis responded negatively to increased disturbance frequency and magnitude, and occupied less primary space in treatments than in controls. Small-scale biological disturbances, by creating space, may facilitate the success of invasive species and colonial organisms in the development of subtidal hard substrate communities.","['Whitlatch R.B.', 'Altman S.']",10.1016/J.JEMBE.2006.10.011,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4d1446763742611154a5391c090bb3af7f5452a8,1,2000,Effects of small-scale disturbance on invasion success in marine communities,,,['Biology'],Motor Control

"The phenotypic plasticity and the competitive ability of the invasive Acacia longifolia v. the indigenous Mediterranean dune species Halimium halimifolium and Pinus pinea were evaluated. In particular, we explored the hypothesis that phenotypic plasticity in response to biotic and abiotic factors explains the observed differences in competitiveness between invasive and native species. The seedlings’ ability to exploit different resource availabilities was examined in a two factorial experimental design of light and nutrient treatments by analysing 20 physiological and morphological traits. Competitiveness was tested using an additive experimental design in combination with 15N-labelling experiments. Light and nutrient availability had only minor effects on most physiological traits and differences between species were not significant. Plasticity in response to changes in resource availability occurred in morphological and allocation traits, revealing A. longifolia to be a species of intermediate responsiveness. The major competitive advantage of A. longifolia was its constitutively high shoot elongation rate at most resource treatments and its effective nutrient acquisition. Further, A. longifolia was found to be highly tolerant against competition from native species. In contrast to common expectations, the competition experiment indicated that A. longifolia expressed a constant allocation pattern and a phenotypic plasticity similar to that of the native species.","['Beyschlag W', 'Werner C', 'Peperkorn R']",10.1071/fp04197,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/fp04197,1,2000,Phenotypic plasticity of an invasive acacia versus two native Mediterranean species,['Functional Plant Biology'],"(['Plant Science', 'Agronomy and Crop Science'],)",,Motor Control

Results            Our results show that Daphnia populations co-existing with fish have undergone rapid adaptive reductions in body size and in the timing of reproduction. Size-related traits decreased by up to 13 percent in response to introduced fish. Rates of evolutionary change are as high as 4,238 darwins (0.036 haldanes).                                Conclusion            Species introductions into aquatic habitats can dramatically alter the selective environment of native species leading to a rapid evolutionary response. Knowledge of the rates and limits of adaptation is an important component of understanding the long-term effects of alterations in the species composition of communities. We discuss the evolutionary consequences of species introductions and compare the rate of evolution observed in the Sierra Nevada Daphnia to published estimates of evolutionary change in ecological timescales.","['Pfrender ME', 'Knapp RA', 'Latta IV LC', 'Fisk DL']",10.1186/1471-2148-7-22,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-7-22,1,2000,Rapid evolution in response to introduced predators I: rates and patterns of morphological and life-history trait divergence,['BMC Evolutionary Biology'],"(['Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics'],)",,Motor Control

"Holcus lanatus L. can colonise a wide range of sites within the naturalised grassland of the Humid Dominion of Chile. The objectives were to determine plant growth mechanisms and strategies that have allowed H. lanatus to colonise contrasting pastures and to determine the existence of ecotypes of H. lanatus in southern Chile. Plants of H. lanatus were collected from four geographic zones of southern Chile and established in a randomised complete block design with four replicates. Five newly emerging tillers were marked per plant and evaluated at the vegetative, pre-ear emergence, complete emerged inflorescence, end of flowering period, and mature seed stages. At each evaluation, one marked tiller was harvested per plant. The variables measured included lamina length and width, tiller height, length of the inflorescence, total number of leaves, and leaf, stem, and inflorescence mass. At each phenological stage, groups of accessions were statistically formed using cluster analysis. The grouping of accessions (cluster analysis) into statistically different groups (ANOVA and canonical variate analysis) indicated the existence of different ecotypes. The phenotypic variation within each group of the accessions suggested that each group has its own phenotypic plasticity. It is concluded that the successful colonisation by H. lanatus has resulted from diversity within the species.","['Valdes C', 'Kemp PD', 'Balocchi OA', 'Lopez IF']",10.1071/cp09001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/cp09001,1,2000,Phenotypic variability in Holcus lanatus L. in southern Chile: a strategy that enhances plant survival and pasture stability,['Crop and Pasture Science'],"(['Plant Science', 'Agronomy and Crop Science'],)",,Motor Control

"The mechanisms underlying successful biological invasions often remain unclear. In the case of the tropical water flea            Daphnia lumholtzi            , which invaded North America, it has been suggested that this species possesses a high thermal tolerance, which in the course of global climate change promotes its establishment and rapid spread. However,            D. lumholtzi            has an additional remarkable feature: it is the only water flea that forms rigid head spines in response to chemicals released in the presence of fishes. These morphologically (phenotypically) plastic traits serve as an inducible defence against these predators. Here, we show in controlled mesocosm experiments that the native North American species            Daphnia pulicaria            is competitively superior to            D. lumholtzi            in the absence of predators. However, in the presence of fish predation the invasive species formed its defences and became dominant. This observation of a predator-mediated switch in dominance suggests that the inducible defence against fish predation may represent a key adaptation for the invasion success of            D. lumholtzi            .","['Tollrian R', 'Engel K']",10.1098/rspb.2008.1861,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2008.1861,1,2000,Inducible defences as key adaptations for the successful invasion of Daphnia lumholtzi in North America?,['Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences'],"(['General Agricultural and Biological Sciences', 'General Environmental Science', 'General Immunology and Microbiology', 'General Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology', 'General Medicine'],)",,Motor Control

"Background            The invasive Chondrostoma nasus nasus has colonized part of the distribution area of the protected endemic species Chondrostoma toxostoma toxostoma. This hybrid zone is a complex system where multiple effects such as inter-species competition, bi-directional introgression, strong environmental pressure and so on are combined. Why do sympatric Chondrostoma fish present a unidirectional change in body shape? Is this the result of inter-species interactions and/or a response to environmental effects or the result of trade-offs? Studies focusing on the understanding of a trade-off between multiple parameters are still rare. Although this has previously been done for Cichlid species flock and for Darwin finches, where mouth or beak morphology were coupled to diet and genetic identification, no similar studies have been done for a fish hybrid zone in a river. We tested the correlation between morphology (body and mouth morphology), diet (stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes) and genomic combinations in different allopatric and sympatric populations for a global data set of 1330 specimens. To separate the species interaction effect from the environmental effect in sympatry, we distinguished two data sets: the first one was obtained from a highly regulated part of the river and the second was obtained from specimens coming from the less regulated part.                                Results            The distribution of the hybrid combinations was different in the two part of the sympatric zone, whereas all the specimens presented similar overall changes in body shape and in mouth morphology. Sympatric specimens were also characterized by a larger diet behavior variance than reference populations, characteristic of an opportunistic diet. No correlation was established between the body shape (or mouth deformation) and the stable isotope signature.                                Conclusion            The Durance River is an untamed Mediterranean river despite the presence of numerous dams that split the river from upstream to downstream. The sympatric effect on morphology and the large diet behavior range can be explained by a tendency toward an opportunistic behavior of the sympatric specimens. Indeed, the similar response of the two species and their hybrids implied an adaptation that could be defined as an alternative trade-off that underline the importance of epigenetics mechanisms for potential success in a novel environment.","['Gilles A', 'Grey J', 'Chappaz R', 'Pech N', 'Costedoat C', 'Corse E']",10.1186/1742-9994-6-26,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1742-9994-6-26,1,2000,Trade-off between morphological convergence and opportunistic diet behavior in fish hybrid zone ,['Frontiers in Zoology'],"(['Animal Science and Zoology', 'Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics'],)",,Motor Control

"SUMMARY               The invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) has quickly colonized shallow-water habitats in the North American Great Lakes since the 1980s but the quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis) is becoming dominant in both shallow and deep-water habitats. While quagga mussel shell morphology differs between shallow and deep habitats, functional causes and consequences of such difference are unknown. We examined whether quagga mussel shell morphology could be induced by three environmental variables through developmental plasticity. We predicted that shallow-water conditions (high temperature, food quantity, water motion) would yield a morphotype typical of wild quagga mussels from shallow habitats, while deep-water conditions (low temperature, food quantity, water motion) would yield a morphotype present in deep habitats. We tested this prediction by examining shell morphology and growth rate of quagga mussels collected from shallow and deep habitats and reared under common-garden treatments that manipulated the three variables. Shell morphology was quantified using the polar moment of inertia. Of the variables tested, temperature had the greatest effect on shell morphology. Higher temperature (∼18–20°C) yielded a morphotype typical of wild shallow mussels regardless of the levels of food quantity or water motion. In contrast, lower temperature (∼6–8°C) yielded a morphotype approaching that of wild deep mussels. If shell morphology has functional consequences in particular habitats, a plastic response might confer quagga mussels with a greater ability than zebra mussels to colonize a wider range of habitats within the Great Lakes.","['Lee CE', 'Hermanson JC', 'Peyer SM']",10.1242/jeb.042549,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.042549,1,2000,Developmental plasticity of shell morphology of quagga mussels from shallow and deep-water habitats of the Great Lakes ,['Journal of Experimental Biology'],"(['Insect Science', 'Molecular Biology', 'Animal Science and Zoology', 'Aquatic Science', 'Physiology', 'Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics'],)",,Motor Control

"Two geographically distinct populations of the submerged aquatic macrophyte Ceratophyllum demersum L. were compared after acclimation to five different nitrogen concentrations (0.005, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mM N) in a common garden setup. The two populations were an apparent invasive population from New Zealand (NZ) and a noninvasive population from Denmark (DK). The populations were compared with a focus on both morphological and physiological traits. The NZ population had higher relative growth rates (RGRs) and photosynthesis rates (Pmax) (range: RGR, 0.06–0.08 per day; Pmax, 200–395 µmol O2 g–1 dry mass (DM) h–1) compared with the Danish population (range: RGR, 0.02–0.05 per day; Pmax, 88–169 µmol O2 g–1 DM h–1). The larger, faster-growing NZ population also showed higher plasticity than the DK population in response to nitrogen in traits important for growth. Hence, the observed differences in growth behaviour between the two populations are a result of genetic differences and differences in their level of plasticity. Here, we show that two populations of the same species from similar climates but different geographical areas can differ in several ecophysiological traits after growth in a common garden setup.","['Brix H', 'Riis T', 'Olesen B', 'Sorrell B', 'Hyldgaard B']",10.1071/fp12068,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/fp12068,1,2000,"Geographically distinct Ceratophyllum demersum populations differ in growth, photosynthetic responses and phenotypic plasticity to nitrogen availability",['Functional Plant Biology'],"(['Plant Science', 'Agronomy and Crop Science'],)",,Motor Control

"The variability of shell morphology and relative growth of the invasive pearl oyster Pinctada radiata was studied within and among ten populations from coastal Tunisia using discriminant tests. Therefore, 12 morphological characters were examined and 34 metric and weight ratios were defined. In addition to the classic morphological characters, populations were compared by the thickness of the nacreous layer. Results of Duncan's multiple comparison test showed that the most discriminative ratios were the width of nacreous layer of right valve to the inflation of shell, the hinge line length to the maximum width of shell and the nacre thickness to the maximum width of shell. The analysis of variance revealed an important inter-population morphological variability. Both multidimensional scaling analysis and the squared Mahalanobis distances (D2) of metric ratios divided Tunisian P. radiata populations into four biogeographical groupings: the north coast (La Marsa); harbours (Hammamet, Monastir and Zarzis); the Gulf of Gabès (Sfax, Kerkennah Island, Maharès, Skhira and Djerba) and the intertidal area (Ajim). However, the Kerkennah Island population was discriminated by the squared Mahalanobis distances (D2) of weight ratios in an isolated group suggesting particular trophic conditions in this area. The allometric study revealed high linear correlation between shell morphological characters and differences in allometric growth among P. radiata populations. Unlike the morphological discrimination, allometric differentiation shows no clear geographical distinction. This study revealed that the pearl oyster P. radiata exhibited considerable phenotypic plasticity related to differences of environmental and/or ecological conditions along Tunisian coasts and highlighted the discriminative character of the nacreous layer thickness parameter.","['Aloui-Bejaoui N', 'Derbali A', 'Gharsalli R', 'Dkhili S', 'Bellaaj-Zouari A']",10.1017/s0025315411001925,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0025315411001925,1,2000,Shell morphology and relative growth variability of the invasive pearl oyster Pinctada radiata in coastal Tunisia,['Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom'],"(['Aquatic Science'],)",,Motor Control

"Phenotypic plasticity and rapid evolution are two important strategies by which invasive species adapt to a wide range of environments and consequently are closely associated with plant invasion. To test their importance in invasion success of Crofton weed, we examined the phenotypic response and genetic variation of the weed by conducting a field investigation, common garden experiments, and intersimple sequence repeat (ISSR) marker analysis on 16 populations in China. Molecular markers revealed low genetic variation among and within the sampled populations. There were significant differences in leaf area (LA), specific leaf area (SLA), and seed number (SN) among field populations, and plasticity index (PIv) for LA, SLA, and SN were 0.62, 0.46 and 0.85, respectively. Regression analyses revealed a significant quadratic effect of latitude of population origin on LA, SLA, and SN based on field data but not on traits in the common garden experiments (greenhouse and open air). Plants from different populations showed similar reaction norms across the two common gardens for functional traits. LA, SLA, aboveground biomass, plant height at harvest, first flowering day, and life span were higher in the greenhouse than in the open-air garden, whereas SN was lower. Growth conditions (greenhouse vs. open air) and the interactions between growth condition and population origin significantly affect plant traits. The combined evidence suggests high phenotypic plasticity but low genetically based variation for functional traits of Crofton weed in the invaded range. Therefore, we suggest that phenotypic plasticity is the primary strategy for Crofton weed as an aggressive invader that can adapt to diverse environments in China.","['Sun S', 'Gao X', 'Xi X', 'Yang X', 'Zhao YJ']",10.1614/ws-d-11-00198.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1614/ws-d-11-00198.1,1,2000,Phenotypic Plasticity in the Invasion of Crofton Weed (Eupatorium adenophorum) in China,['Weed Science'],"(['Plant Science', 'Agronomy and Crop Science'],)",,Motor Control

"While phenotypic plasticity is considered the major means that allows plant to cope with environmental heterogeneity, scant information is available on phenotypic plasticity of the whole-plant architecture in relation to ontogenic processes. We performed an architectural analysis to gain an understanding of the structural and ontogenic properties of common buckthorn ( Rhamnus cathartica L., Rhamnaceae) growing in the understory and under an open canopy. We found that ontogenic effects on growth need to be calibrated if a full description of phenotypic plasticity is to be obtained. Our analysis pointed to three levels of organization (or nested structural units) in R. cathartica. Their modulation in relation to light conditions leads to the expression of two architectural strategies that involve sets of traits known to confer competitive advantage in their respective environments. In the understory, the plant develops a tree-like form. Its strategy here is based on restricting investment in exploitation structures while promoting major vertical exploration and is probably key to species survival in the understory. Under an open canopy, the second strategy leads the plant to adopt a shrub-like shape. It develops densely branched exploitation structures and flowers abundantly and rapidly. This strategy perfectly matches its aggressive behaviour observed in full sunlight. We propose, as hypotheses, that these two light-related strategies are implicated in the ability of R. cathartica to outcompete the surrounding vegetation in a range of environmental conditions.","['Bouchard A', 'Brisson J', 'Edelin C', 'Charles-Dominique T']",10.1139/b2012-069,http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b2012-069,1,2000,Architectural strategies of Rhamnus cathartica (Rhamnaceae) in relation to canopy openness,['Botany'],"(['Plant Science', 'Ecology', 'Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics'],)",,Motor Control

"Invasive alien species might benefit from phenotypic plasticity by being able to (i) maintain fitness in stressful environments (‘robust’), (ii) increase fitness in favourable environments (‘opportunistic’), or (iii) combine both abilities (‘robust and opportunistic’). Here, we applied this framework, for the first time, to an animal, the invasive slug,            Arion lusitanicus            , and tested (i) whether it has a more adaptive phenotypic plasticity compared with a congeneric native slug,            Arion fuscus            , and (ii) whether it is robust, opportunistic or both. During one year, we exposed specimens of both species to a range of temperatures along an altitudinal gradient (700–2400 m a.s.l.) and to high and low food levels, and we compared the responsiveness of two fitness traits: survival and egg production            .            During summer, the invasive species had a more adaptive phenotypic plasticity, and at high temperatures and low food levels, it survived better and produced more eggs than            A. fuscus            , representing the robust phenotype. During winter,            A. lusitanicus            displayed a less adaptive phenotype than            A. fuscus            . We show that the framework developed for plants is also very useful for a better mechanistic understanding of animal invasions.

"Despite long-standing interest of terrestrial ecologists, freshwater ecosystems are a fertile, yet unappreciated, testing ground for applying community phylogenetics to uncover mechanisms of species assembly. We quantify phylogenetic clustering and overdispersion of native and non-native fishes of a large river basin in the American Southwest to test for the mechanisms (environmental filtering versus competitive exclusion) and spatial scales influencing community structure. Contrary to expectations, non-native species were phylogenetically clustered and related to natural environmental conditions, whereas native species were not phylogenetically structured, likely reflecting human-related changes to the basin. The species that are most invasive (in terms of ecological impacts) tended to be the most phylogenetically divergent from natives across watersheds, but not within watersheds, supporting the hypothesis that Darwin's naturalization conundrum is driven by the spatial scale. Phylogenetic distinctiveness may facilitate non-native establishment at regional scales, but environmental filtering restricts local membership to closely related species with physiological tolerances for current environments. By contrast, native species may have been phylogenetically clustered in historical times, but species loss from contemporary populations by anthropogenic activities has likely shaped the phylogenetic signal. Our study implies that fundamental mechanisms of community assembly have changed, with fundamental consequences for the biogeography of both native and non-native species.","['Olden J.D.', 'Strecker A.L.']",10.1098/rspb.2013.3003,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2013.3003,1,2000,Fish species introductions provide novel insights into the patterns and drivers of phylogenetic structure in freshwaters,['Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences'],"(['General Agricultural and Biological Sciences', 'General Environmental Science', 'General Immunology and Microbiology', 'General Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology', 'General Medicine'],)",,Motor Control

"The success of nonindigenous species may be influenced by biotic interactions during the initial stages of invasion. Here, we investigated whether a potential invader, Solidago virgaurea L., would experience more damage by natural enemies in communities dominated by close relatives than those without them; interactions with mutualistic mycorrhizae might partially counteract these effects. We monitored damage experienced by S. virgaurea planted into communities with native congeners and without close relatives. Community type was crossed with a vegetation removal treatment to assess the combined effects of herbivory and competition on survival. We also evaluated growth of S. virgaurea in a greenhouse experiment where seedlings were exposed to soil biota sampled from these communities and compared with sterile controls. Overall, community type did not affect levels of herbivory or plant survival. Removal of surrounding vegetation resulted in reduced damage and increased survival; these effects were largest in grass-dominated communities. Soil sterilization reduced root growth and tended to reduce shoot growth, especially when compared with plants inoculated with biota collected near congeners. Overall, our results suggest that the presence of close relatives is unlikely to make old-field communities more resistant to invasion by S. virgaurea; instead, soil biota might facilitate growth in communities dominated by close relatives.","['Kotanen P.M.', 'Hill S.B.']",10.1139/b11-084,http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b11-084,1,2000,Biotic interactions experienced by a new invader: effects of its close relatives at the community scale,['Botany'],"(['Plant Science', 'Ecology', 'Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics'],)",,Motor Control

"Darwin proposed two contradictory hypotheses to explain the influence of congeners on the outcomes of invasion: the naturalization hypothesis, which predicts a negative relationship between the presence of congeners and invasion success, and the pre-adaptation hypothesis, which predicts a positive relationship between the presence of congeners and invasion success. Studies testing these hypotheses have shown mixed support. We tested these hypotheses using the establishment success of non-native reptiles and congener presence/absence and richness across the globe. Our results demonstrated support for the pre-adaptation hypothesis. We found that globally, both on islands and continents, establishment success was higher in the presence than in the absence of congeners and that establishment success increased with increasing congener richness. At the life form level, establishment success was higher for lizards, marginally higher for snakes, and not different for turtles in the presence of congeners; data were insufficient to test the hypotheses for crocodiles. There was no relationship between establishment success and congener richness for any life form. We suggest that we found support for the pre-adaptation hypothesis because, at the scale of our analysis, native congeners represent environmental conditions appropriate for the species rather than competition for niche space. Our results imply that areas to target for early detection of non-native reptiles are those that host closely related species.","['Callahan C.M.', 'Poessel S.A.', 'Peterson S.L.', 'Beard K.H.', 'Ferreira R.B.']",10.1163/15685381-00002841,http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15685381-00002841,1,2000,Establishment of introduced reptiles increases with the presence and richness of native congeners,['Amphibia-Reptilia'],"(['Animal Science and Zoology', 'Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics'],)",,Motor Control

"Naturalized plants can have a significant ecological and economic impact, yet they comprise only a fraction of the plant species introduced into new areas by humans. Darwin proposed that introduced plant species will be less likely to establish a self-sustaining wild population in places with congeneric native species because the introduced plants have to compete with their close native relatives, or are more likely to be attacked by native herbivores or pathogens, a theory known as Darwin's naturalization hypothesis. Here we analyse a complete list of seed-plant species that have been introduced to New Zealand and find that those with congeneric relatives are significantly more, not less, likely to naturalize — perhaps because they share with their native relatives traits that pre-adapt them to their new environment.","['Williams P.A.', 'Duncan R.P.']",10.1038/417608a,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b788b5b53aa3de0bff79bc4794a5489de7533f1e,1,2000,Ecology: Darwin's naturalization hypothesis challenged,Nature,,"['Biology', 'Medicine']",Motor Control

"Understanding the relative importance of various functional groups in minimizing invasion by medusahead is central to increasing the resistance of native plant communities. The objective of this study was to determine the relative importance of key functional groups within an intact Wyoming big sagebrush–bluebunch wheatgrass community type on minimizing medusahead invasion. Treatments consisted of removal of seven functional groups at each of two sites, one with shrubs and one without shrubs. Removal treatments included (1) everything, (2) shrubs, (3) perennial grasses, (4) taprooted forbs, (5) rhizomatous forbs, (6) annual forbs, and (7) mosses. A control where nothing was removed was also established. Plots were arranged in a randomized complete block with 4 replications (blocks) at each site. Functional groups were removed beginning in the spring of 2004 and maintained monthly throughout each growing season through 2009. Medusahead was seeded at a rate of 2,000 seeds m−2 (186 seeds ft−2) in fall 2005. Removing perennial grasses nearly doubled medusahead density and biomass compared with any other removal treatment. The second highest density and biomass of medusahead occurred from removing rhizomatous forbs (phlox). We found perennial grasses played a relatively more significant role than other species in minimizing invasion by medusahead. We suggest that the most effective basis for establishing medusahead-resistant plant communities is to establish 2 or 3 highly productive grasses that are complementary in niche and that overlap that of the invading species.","['James J.', 'Sheley R.L.']",10.1614/ipsm-d-09-00056.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1614/ipsm-d-09-00056.1,1,2000,Resistance of Native Plant Functional Groups to Invasion by Medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae),['Invasive Plant Science and Management'],"(['Plant Science'],)",,Motor Control

"Preventing invasion by exotic species is one of the key goals of restoration, and community assembly theory provides testable predictions about native community attributes that will best resist invasion. For instance, resource availability and biotic interactions may represent “filters” that limit the success of potential invaders. Communities are predicted to resist invasion when they contain native species that are functionally similar to potential invaders; where phenology may be a key functional trait. Nutrient reduction is another common strategy for reducing invasion following native species restoration, because soil nitrogen (N) enrichment often facilitates invasion. Here, we focus on restoring the herbaceous community associated with coastal sage scrub vegetation in Southern California; these communities are often highly invaded, especially by exotic annual grasses that are notoriously challenging for restoration. We created experimental plant communities composed of the same 20 native species, but manipulated functional group abundance (according to growth form, phenology, and N-fixation capacity) and soil N availability. We fertilized to increase N, and added carbon to reduce N via microbial N immobilization. We found that N reduction decreased exotic cover, and the most successful seed mix for reducing exotic abundance varied depending on the invader functional type. For instance, exotic annual grasses were least abundant when the native community was dominated by early active forbs, which matched the phenology of the exotic annual grasses. Our findings show that nutrient availability and the timing of biotic interactions are key filters that can be manipulated in restoration to prevent invasion and maximize native species recovery.","['Suding K.N.', 'Larios L.', 'Cleland E.E.']",10.1111/J.1526-100X.2012.00896.X,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/63b96fa9dfa75d3b8b7a0047b0c62d0a0e7d1b88,1,2000,Strengthening Invasion Filters to Reassemble Native Plant Communities: Soil Resources and Phenological Overlap,,,['Biology'],Motor Control

"In order to understand invasions, it is important to know how alien species exploit opportunities in unfamiliar ecosystems. For example, are aliens concentrated in niches under-exploited by native communities, or widely distributed across the ecological spectrum? To explore this question, we compared the niches occupied by 394 naturalized alien plants with a representative sample from the native flora of Mediterranean islands. When niche structure was described by a functional group categorization, the distribution of native and alien species was remarkably similar, although “succulent shrubs” and “trees with specialized animal pollination mechanisms” were under-represented in the native species pool. When niche structure was described by Grime’s CSR strategy, the positioning of aliens and natives differed more strongly. Stress-tolerance was much rarer amongst the aliens, and a competitive strategy was more prevalent at the habitat level. This pattern is similar to previous findings in temperate Europe, although in those regions it closely reflects patterns of native diversity. Stressed environments are much more dominant in the Mediterranean. We discuss a number of factors which may contribute to this difference, e.g., competitive and ruderal niches are often associated with anthropogenic habitats, and their high invasibility may be due partly to introduction patterns rather than to a greater efficiency of aliens at exploiting them. Thus far, the reasons for invasion success amongst introduced species have proved difficult to unravel. Despite some differences, our evidence suggests that alien species naturalize across a wide range of niches. Given that their ecologies therefore vary greatly, one may ask why such species should be expected to share predictable traits at all?","['Hulme P.E.', 'Lloret F.', 'Lambdon P.W.']",10.1007/s10530-007-9163-4,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7d2f0307134c4db434d47813dc6a6445c6f01f7d,1,2000,Do alien plants on Mediterranean islands tend to invade different niches from native species?,Biological Invasions,,['Biology'],Motor Control
"Theory has predicted, and many experimental studies have confirmed, that resident plant species richness is inversely related to invisibility. Likewise, potential invaders that are functionally similar to resident plant species are less likely to invade than are those from different functional groups. Neither of these ideas has been tested in the context of an operational prairie restoration. Here, we tested the hypotheses that within tallgrass prairie restorations (1) as seed mix species richness increased, cover of the invasive perennial forb, Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense) would decline; and (2) guilds (both planted and arising from the seedbank) most similar to Canada thistle would have a larger negative effect on it than less similar guilds. Each hypothesis was tested on six former agricultural fields restored to tallgrass prairie in 2005; all were within the tallgrass prairie biome in Minnesota, USA. A mixed-model with repeated measures (years) in a randomized block (fields) design indicated that seed mix richness had no effect on cover of Canada thistle. Structural equation models assessing effects of cover of each planted and non-planted guild on cover of Canada thistle in 2006, 2007, and 2010 revealed that planted Asteraceae never had a negative effect on Canada thistle. In contrast, planted cool-season grasses and non-Asteraceae forbs, and many non-planted guilds had negative effects on Canada thistle cover. We conclude that early, robust establishment of native species, regardless of guild, is of greater importance in resistance to Canada thistle than is similarity of guilds in new prairie restorations.","['Rabie P.A. et al.', 'Palaia N.', 'Larson J.L.', 'Drobney P.', 'Bright J.B.', 'Larson D.L.']",10.1007/s10530-013-0432-0,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2615b80c57a9dc14f9b1e2c562cd343d8ba04005,1,2000,Using prairie restoration to curtail invasion of Canada thistle: the importance of limiting similarity and seed mix richness,Biological Invasions,,['Biology'],Motor Control

"The importance of species richness for repelling exotic plant invasions varies from ecosystem to ecosystem. Thus, in order to prioritize conservation objectives, it is critical to identify those ecosystems where decreasing richness will most greatly magnify invasion risks. Our goal was to determine if invasion risks greatly increase in response to common reductions in grassland species richness. We imposed treatments that mimic management-induced reductions in grassland species richness (i.e., removal of shallow- and/or deep-rooted forbs and/or grasses and/or cryptogam layers). Then we introduced and monitored the performance of a notorious invasive species (i.e., Centaurea maculosa). We found that, on a per-gram-of-biomass basis, each resident plant group similarly suppressed invader growth. Hence, with respect to preventing C. maculosa invasions, maintaining overall productivity is probably more important than maintaining the productivity of particular plant groups or species. But at the sites we studied, all plant groups may be needed to maintain overall productivity because removing forbs decreased overall productivity in two of three years. Alternatively, removing forbs increased productivity in another year, and this led us to posit that removing forbs may inflate the temporal productivity variance as opposed to greatly affecting time-averaged productivity. In either case, overall productivity responses to single plant group removals were inconsistent and fairly modest, and only when all plant groups were removed did C. maculosa growth increase substantially over a no-removal treatment. As such, it seems that intense disturbances (e.g., prolonged drought, overgrazing) that deplete multiple plant groups may often be a prerequisite for C. maculosa invasion.","['Rekaya R.', 'Pokorny M.L.', 'Rinella M.J.']",10.1890/06-1881.1,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/800f9b0cb8fccbea84b58feac4bbdb3e27ba60e6,1,2000,Grassland invader responses to realistic changes in native species richness,Ecological applications : a publication of the Ecological Society of America,,"['Biology', 'Medicine']",Motor Control

"<jats:sec id=""sec001"">IntroductionThe intestinal microbiota comprises bacteria, fungi, archaea, protists, helminths and viruses that symbiotically inhabit the digestive system. To date, research has provided limited data on the possible association between an active lifestyle and a healthy composition of human microbiota. This review was aimed to summarize the results of human studies comparing the microbiome of healthy individuals with different physical activity amounts.<jats:sec id=""sec002"">MethodsWe searched Medline/Ovid, NIH/PubMed, and Academic Search Complete between August–October 2020. Inclusion criteria comprised: (a) cross-sectional studies focused on comparing gut microbiome among subjects with different physical activity levels; (b) studies describing human gut microbiome responses to any type of exercise stimulus; (c) studies containing healthy adult women and men. We excluded studies containing diet modifications, probiotic or prebiotic consumption, as well as studies focused on diabetes, hypertension, cancer, hormonal dysfunction. Methodological quality and risk of bias for each study were assessed using the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies—of Interventions tool. The results from cross-sectional and longitudinal studies are shown independently.<jats:sec id=""sec003"">ResultsA total of 17 articles were eligible for inclusion: ten cross-sectional and seven longitudinal studies. Main outcomes vary significantly according to physical activity amounts in longitudinal studies.

"The effect of rhizosphere soil or root tissues amendments on the microbial mineralisation of hydrocarbons in soil slurry by the indigenous microbial communities has been investigated. In this study, rhizosphere soil and root tissues of reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea), channel grass (Vallisneria spiralis), blackberry (Rubus fructicosus) and goat willow (Salix caprea) were collected from the former Shell and Imperial Industries (ICI) Refinery site in Lancaster, UK. The rates and extents of 14C–hydrocarbons (naphthalene, phenanthrene, hexadecane or octacosane) mineralisation in artificially spiked soils were monitored in the absence and presence of 5% (wet weight) of rhizosphere soil or root tissues. Respirometric and microbial assays were monitored in fresh (0 d) and pre–incubated (28 d) artificially spiked soils following amendment with rhizosphere soil or root tissues. There were significant increases (P < 0.001) in the extents of 14C–naphthalene and 14C–phenanthrene mineralisation in fresh artificially spiked soils amended with rhizosphere soil and root tissues compared to those measured in unamended soils. However, amendment of fresh artificially spiked soils with rhizosphere soil and root tissues did not enhance the microbial mineralisation of 14C–hexadecane or 14C–octacosane by indigenous microbial communities. Apart from artificially spiked soil systems containing naphthalene (amended with reed canary grass and channel grass rhizosphere) and hexadecane amended with goat willow rhizosphere, microbial mineralisation of hydrocarbons was further enhanced following 28 d soil–organic contaminants pre–exposure and subsequent amendment with rhizosphere soil or root tissues. This study suggests that organic chemicals in roots and/or rhizosphere can enhance the microbial degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in freshly contaminated soil by supporting higher numbers of hydrocarbon–degrading populations, promoting microbial activity and/or enhancing bioavailability of organic contaminants.","['Semple, Kirk T.', 'Hanney, Nicola F.', 'Adebisi, Olusoji O.', 'Aniefiok Ite']",10.12691/IJEBB-4-2-1,http://pubs.sciepub.com/ijebb/4/2/1,6,2016,The Effect of Rhizosphere Soil and Root Tissues Amendment on Microbial Mineralisation of Target 14C–Hydrocarbons in Contaminated Soil,International Journal of Environmental Bioremediation & Biodegradation,,['Biology'],Environmental Microbiology and Microbial Ecology

"Microorganisms are well adapted to their habitat but are partially sensitive to toxic metabolites or abiotic compounds secreted by other organisms or chemically formed under the respective environmental conditions. Thermoacidophiles are challenged by pyroglutamate, a lactam that is spontaneously formed by cyclization of glutamate under aerobic thermoacidophilic conditions. It is known that growth of the thermoacidophilic crenarchaeonSaccharolobus solfataricus(formerlySulfolobus solfataricus) is completely inhibited by pyroglutamate. In the present study, we investigated the effect of pyroglutamate on the growth ofS. solfataricusand the closely related crenarchaeonSulfolobus acidocaldarius.In contrast toS. solfataricus,S. acidocaldariuswas successfully cultivated with pyroglutamate as a sole carbon source. Bioinformatical analyses showed that both members of theSulfolobaceaehave at least one candidate for a 5-oxoprolinase, which catalyses the ATP-dependent conversion of pyroglutamate to glutamate. InS. solfataricus, we observed the intracellular accumulation of pyroglutamate and crude cell extract assays showed a less effective degradation of pyroglutamate. Apparently,S. acidocaldariusseems to be less versatile regarding carbohydrates and prefers peptidolytic growth compared toS. solfataricus. Concludingly,S. acidocaldariusexhibits a more efficient utilization of pyroglutamate and is not inhibited by this compound, making it a better candidate for applications with glutamate-containing media at high temperatures.","['Meina Neumann-Schaal', 'Dietmar Schomburg', 'Julia Helmecke', 'Anna M.

"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are ancient and conserved across the tree of life. Their efficacy over evolutionary time has been largely attributed to their mechanisms of killing. Yet, the understanding of their pharmacodynamics both            in vivo            and            in vitro            is very limited. This is, however, crucial for applications of AMPs as drugs and also informs the understanding of the action of AMPs in natural immune systems. Here, we selected six different AMPs from different organisms to test their individual and combined effects            in vitro            . We analyzed their pharmacodynamics based on the Hill function and evaluated the interaction of combinations of two and three AMPs. Interactions of AMPs in our study were mostly synergistic, and three-AMP combinations displayed stronger synergism than two-AMP combinations. This suggests synergism to be a common phenomenon in AMP interaction. Additionally, AMPs displayed a sharp increase in killing within a narrow dose range, contrasting with those of antibiotics. We suggest that our results could lead a way toward better evaluation of AMP application in practice and shed some light on the evolutionary consequences of antimicrobial peptide interactions within the immune system of organisms.","['Jens Rolff', 'Roland R.

"Antibiotic resistance constitutes one of the most pressing public health concerns. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) of multicellular organisms are considered part of a solution to this problem, and AMPs produced by bacteria such as colistin are last-resort drugs. Importantly, AMPs differ from many antibiotics in their pharmacodynamic characteristics. Here we implement these differences within a theoretical framework to predict the evolution of resistance against AMPs and compare it to antibiotic resistance. Our analysis of resistance evolution finds that pharmacodynamic differences all combine to produce a much lower probability that resistance will evolve against AMPs. The finding can be generalized to all drugs with pharmacodynamics similar to AMPs. Pharmacodynamic concepts are familiar to most practitioners of medical microbiology, and data can be easily obtained for any drug or drug combination. Our theoretical and conceptual framework is, therefore, widely applicable and can help avoid resistance evolution if implemented in antibiotic stewardship schemes or the rational choice of new drug candidates.","['Roland R.

"The selection of bacterial resistance was examined in relationship to antibiotic pharmacokinetics (PK) and organism MICs in the patients from four nosocomial lower respiratory tract infection clinical trials. The evaluable database included 107 acutely ill patients, 128 pathogens, and five antimicrobial regimens. Antimicrobial pharmacokinetics were characterized by using serum concentrations, and culture and sensitivity tests were performed daily on tracheal aspirates to examine resistance. Pharmacodynamic (PD) models were developed to identify factors associated with the probability of developing bacterial resistance. Overall, in 32 of 128 (25%) initially susceptible cases resistance developed during therapy. An initial univariate screen and a classification and regression tree analysis identified the ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h to the MIC (AUC            0–24            /MIC) as a significant predictor of the development of resistance (            P            &lt; 0.001). The final PK/PD model, a variant of the Hill equation, demonstrated that the probability of developing resistance during therapy increased significantly when antimicrobial exposure was at an AUC            0–24            /MIC ratio of less than 100. This relationship was observed across all treatments and within all organism groupings, with the exception of β-lactamase-producing gram-negative organisms (consistent with type I β-lactamase producers) treated with β-lactam monotherapy. Combination therapy resulted in much lower rates of resistance than monotherapy, probably because all of the combination regimens examined had an AUC            0–24            /MIC ratio in excess of 100. In summary, the selection of antimicrobial resistance appears to be strongly associated with suboptimal antimicrobial exposure, defined as an AUC            0–24            /MIC ratio of less than 100.","['Jerome J.

"Objective            To establish whether there is any change in mortality from infection with a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, designated a variant of concern (VOC-202012/1) in December 2020, compared with circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants.                                Design            Matched cohort study.                                Setting            Community based (pillar 2) covid-19 testing centres in the UK using the TaqPath assay (a proxy measure of VOC-202012/1 infection).                                Participants            54 906 matched pairs of participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in pillar 2 between 1 October 2020 and 29 January 2021, followed-up until 12 February 2021. Participants were matched on age, sex, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation, lower tier local authority region, and sample date of positive specimens, and differed only by detectability of the spike protein gene using the TaqPath assay.                                Main outcome measure            Death within 28 days of the first positive SARS-CoV-2 test result.                                Results            The mortality hazard ratio associated with infection with VOC-202012/1 compared with infection with previously circulating variants was 1.64 (95% confidence interval 1.32 to 2.04) in patients who tested positive for covid-19 in the community. In this comparatively low risk group, this represents an increase in deaths from 2.5 to 4.1 per 1000 detected cases.                                Conclusions            The probability that the risk of mortality is increased by infection with VOC-202012/01 is high. If this finding is generalisable to other populations, infection with VOC-202012/1 has the potential to cause substantial additional mortality compared with previously circulating variants. Healthcare capacity planning and national and international control policies are all impacted by this finding, with increased mortality lending weight to the argument that further coordinated and stringent measures are justified to reduce deaths from SARS-CoV-2.","['Leon Danon', 'Krasimira Tsaneva-Atanasova', 'Louise Dyson', 'Jonathan M Read', 'Ellen Brooks-Pollock', 'Robert Challen']",10.1136/bmj.n579,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.n579,3,2021,Risk of mortality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern 202012/1: matched cohort study,"['BMJ', 'BMJ']","([],)",,Virology

"The rising threat of pandemic viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, requires development of new preclinical discovery platforms that can more rapidly identify therapeutics that are activein vitroand also translatein vivo. Here we show that human organ-on-a-chip (Organ Chip) microfluidic culture devices lined by highly differentiated human primary lung airway epithelium and endothelium can be used to model virus entry, replication, strain-dependent virulence, host cytokine production, and recruitment of circulating immune cells in response to infection by respiratory viruses with great pandemic potential. We provide a first demonstration of drug repurposing by using oseltamivir in influenza A virus-infected organ chip cultures and show that co-administration of the approved anticoagulant drug, nafamostat, can double oseltamivir’s therapeutic time window. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Airway Chips were used to assess the inhibitory activities of approved drugs that showed inhibition in traditional cell culture assays only to find that most failed when tested in the Organ Chip platform. When administered in human Airway Chips under flow at a clinically relevant dose, one drug – amodiaquine - significantly inhibited infection by a pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus. Proof of concept was provided by showing that amodiaquine and its active metabolite (desethylamodiaquine) also significantly reduce viral load in both direct infection and animal-to-animal transmission models of native SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters. These data highlight the value of Organ Chip technology as a more stringent and physiologically relevant platform for drug repurposing, and suggest that amodiaquine should be considered for future clinical testing.","['Donald Ingber', 'Benjamin R. tenOever', 'Matthew Frieman', 'Kenneth Carlson', 'Rani Powers', 'Rachelle Prantil-Baun', 'Sarah Gilpin', 'Girija Goyal', 'Kambez H.

"A novel coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, emerged in 2019 in China and rapidly spread worldwide. As no approved therapeutics exists to treat COVID-19, the disease associated to SARS-Cov-2, there is an urgent need to propose molecules that could quickly enter into clinics. Repurposing of approved drugs is a strategy that can bypass the time-consuming stages of drug development. In this study, we screened the PRESTWICK CHEMICAL LIBRARY composed of 1,520 approved drugs in an infected cell-based assay. The robustness of the screen was assessed by the identification of drugs that already demonstrated in vitro antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2. Thereby, 90 compounds were identified as positive hits from the screen and were grouped according to their chemical composition and their known therapeutic effect. Then EC50 and CC50 were determined for a subset of 15 compounds from a panel of 23 selected drugs covering the different groups. Eleven compounds such as macrolides antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, antiarrhythmic agents or CNS drugs emerged showing antiviral potency with 2 &lt; EC50 ≤ 20 µM. By providing new information on molecules inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro, this study provides information for the selection of drugs to be further validated in vivo.

There are no antiviral drugs with proven clinical efficacy for the treatment of COVID-19, nor are there any vaccines that prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2, and efforts to develop drugs and vaccines are hampered by the limited knowledge of the molecular details of how SARS-CoV-2 infects cells. Here we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins that physically associated with each of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins using affinity-purification mass spectrometry, identifying 332 high-confidence protein–protein interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins. Among these, we identify 66 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 compounds (of which, 29 drugs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, 12 are in clinical trials and 28 are preclinical compounds). We screened a subset of these in multiple viral assays and found two sets of pharmacological agents that displayed antiviral activity: inhibitors of mRNA translation and predicted regulators of the sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors. Further studies of these host-factor-targeting agents, including their combination with drugs that directly target viral enzymes, could lead to a therapeutic regimen to treat COVID-19. A human–SARS-CoV-2 protein interaction map highlights cellular processes that are hijacked by the virus and that can be targeted by existing drugs, including inhibitors of mRNA translation and predicted regulators of the sigma receptors.","['Nevan J.

"Since the emergence of the first cases in Wuhan, China, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has been quickly spreading out to other provinces and neighboring countries. Estimation of the basic reproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity. A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures. The estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71–7.23). Sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019-nCoV infection in Beijing being almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value. It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures implemented by the Chinese authorities can contribute to the prevention and control of the 2019-nCoV infection, and how long they should be maintained. Under the most restrictive measures, the outbreak is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020) with a significant low peak value. With travel restriction (no imported exposed individuals to Beijing), the number of infected individuals in seven days will decrease by 91.14% in Beijing, compared with the scenario of no travel restriction.","['Jianhong Wu', 'Yanni Xiao', 'Sanyi Tang', 'Nicola Luigi Bragazzi', 'Qian Li', 'Xia Wang', 'Biao Tang']",10.3390/jcm9020462,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jcm9020462,2,2020,Estimation of the Transmission Risk of the 2019-nCoV and Its Implication for Public Health Interventions,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"(['General Medicine'],)",,Virology
"Background: In December 2019, an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread to other parts of China and a number of foreign countries. The 2019-nCoV cases might have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV. Methods: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth. The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation. We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for 2019-nCoV to estimate R0. Results: We confirmed that the initial growth phase followed an exponential growth pattern. The under-reporting was likely to have resulted in 469 (95% CI: 403–540) unreported cases from 1 to 15 January 2020. The reporting rate after 17 January 2020 was likely to have increased 21-fold (95% CI: 18–25) in comparison to the situation from 1 to 17 January 2020 on average. We estimated the R0 of 2019-nCoV at 2.56 (95% CI: 2.49–2.63). Conclusion: The under-reporting was likely to have occurred during the first half of January 2020 and should be considered in future investigation.","['Maggie Haitian Wang', 'Daihai He', 'Daozhou Gao', 'Lin Yang', 'Yijun Lou', 'Weiming Wang', 'Guangpu Yang', 'JINJUN RAN', 'Qianying Lin', 'Salihu S.

"RationaleSeveral studies have estimated basic production number of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). However, the time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP during the outbreak remain unclear.ObjectivesWe aimed to estimate the basic and time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP across China, and compared them with SARS.MethodsData on NCP cases by February 7, 2020 were collected from epidemiological investigations or official websites. Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases in Guangdong Province, Beijing and Hong Kong during 2002-2003 were also obtained. We estimated the doubling time, basic reproduction number (R0) and time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of NCP and SARS.Measurements and main resultsAs of February 7, 2020, 34,598 NCP cases were identified in China, and daily confirmed cases decreased after February 4. The doubling time of NCP nationwide was 2.4 days which was shorter than that of SARS in Guangdong (14.3 days), Hong Kong (5.7 days) and Beijing (12.4 days). TheR0of NCP cases nationwide and in Wuhan were 4.5 and 4.4 respectively, which were higher thanR0of SARS in Guangdong (R0=2.3), Hongkong (R0=2.3), and Beijing (R0=2.6). TheRtfor NCP continuously decreased especially after January 16 nationwide and in Wuhan. TheR0for secondary NCP cases in Guangdong was 0.6, and theRtvalues were less than 1 during the epidemic.ConclusionsNCP may have a higher transmissibility than SARS, and the efforts of containing the outbreak are effective.

It is likely, based on the experience of SARS and MERS-CoV, that the number of secondary cases caused by a case of 2019-nCoV is highly variable – with many cases causing no secondary infections, and a few causing many. Whether transmission is continuing at the same rate currently depends on the effectiveness of current control measures implemented in China and the extent to which the populations of affected areas have adopted risk-reducing behaviours. In the absence of antiviral drugs or vaccines, control relies upon the prompt detection and isolation of symptomatic cases. It is unclear at the current time whether this outbreak can be contained within China; uncertainties include the severity spectrum of the disease caused by this virus and whether cases with relatively mild symptoms are able to transmit the virus efficiently. Identification and testing of potential cases need to be as extensive as is permitted by healthcare and diagnostic testing capacity – including the identification, testing and isolation of suspected cases with only mild to moderate disease (e.g. influenza-like illness), when logistically feasible.","['Neil Ferguson', 'Steven Riley', 'Christl Donnelly', 'Marc Baguelin', 'Ilaria Dorigatti', 'Anne Cori', 'Natsuko Imai']",10.25561/77148,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/21f17fdab82c99ddb78119be94be6bba9bf55cd9,1,2020,"Report 3: Transmissibility of 2019-nCoV. 2020.

"On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization was notified about a cluster of pneumonia of unknown aetiology in the city of Wuhan, China.

"BackgroundEstimating key infectious disease parameters from the COVID-19 outbreak is quintessential for modelling studies and guiding intervention strategies. Whereas different estimates for the incubation period distribution and the serial interval distribution have been reported, estimates of the generation interval for COVID-19 have not been provided.MethodsWe used outbreak data from clusters in Singapore and Tianjin, China to estimate the generation interval from symptom onset data while acknowledging uncertainty about the incubation period distribution and the underlying transmission network. From those estimates we obtained the proportions pre-symptomatic transmission and reproduction numbers.ResultsThe mean generation interval was 5.20 (95%CI 3.78-6.78) days for Singapore and 3.95 (95%CI 3.01-4.91) days for Tianjin, China when relying on a previously reported incubation period with mean 5.2 and SD 2.8 days. The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was 48% (95%CI 32-67%) for Singapore and 62% (95%CI 50-76%) for Tianjin, China. Estimates of the reproduction number based on the generation interval distribution were slightly higher than those based on the serial interval distribution.ConclusionsEstimating generation and serial interval distributions from outbreak data requires careful investigation of the underlying transmission network.

"BackgroundThe 2019 novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has been spreading rapidly in China. Decisions about its pandemic threat and the appropriate level of public health response depend heavily on estimates of its basic reproduction number and assessments of interventions conducted in the early stages of the epidemic.MethodsWe conducted a mathematical modeling study using five independent methods to assess the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19, using data on confirmed cases obtained from the China National Health Commission for the period 10th January – 8th February. We analyzed the data for the period before the closure of Wuhan city (10th January – 23rd January) and the post-closure period (23rd January – 8th February) and for the whole period, to assess both the epidemic risk of the virus and the effectiveness of the closure of Wuhan city on spread of COVID-19.FindingsBefore the closure of Wuhan city the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 was 4.38 (95% CI: 3.63 – 5.13), dropping to 3.41 (95% CI: 3.16 – 3.65) after the closure of Wuhan city. Over the entire epidemic period COVID-19 had a basic reproduction number of 3.39 (95% CI: 3.09 – 3.70), indicating it has a very high transmissibility.InterpretationCOVID-19 is a highly transmissible virus with a very high risk of epidemic outbreak once it emerges in metropolitan areas. The closure of Wuhan city was effective in reducing the severity of the epidemic, but even after closure of the city and the subsequent expansion of that closure to other parts of Hubei the virus remained extremely infectious. Emergency planners in other cities should consider this high infectiousness when considering responses to this virus.FundingNational Natural Science Foundation of China, China Medical Board, National Science and Technology Major Project of China","['Yuantao Hao', 'Dong Roman Xu', 'Zhicheng Du', 'Liping Peng', 'Chun Hao', 'Jing Gu', 'Xinyi You', 'Ying Wang', 'Daisuke Yoneoka', 'Mengying Wang', 'Stuart Gilmour', 'Yijing Wang', 'jinghua li']",10.1101/2020.02.18.20024315,http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024315,2,2020,Estimation of the epidemic properties of the 2019 novel coronavirus: A mathematical modeling study,medRxiv,"([],)",,Virology
"In the night of February 20, 2020, the first case of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was confirmed in the Lombardy Region, Italy. In the week that followed, Lombardy experienced a very rapid increase in the number of cases. We analyzed the first 5,830 laboratory-confirmed cases to provide the first epidemiological characterization of a COVID-19 outbreak in a Western Country. Epidemiological data were collected through standardized interviews of confirmed cases and their close contacts. We collected demographic backgrounds, dates of symptom onset, clinical features, respiratory tract specimen results, hospitalization, contact tracing. We provide estimates of the reproduction number and serial interval. The epidemic in Italy started much earlier than February 20, 2020. At the time of detection of the first COVID-19 case, the epidemic had already spread in most municipalities of Southern-Lombardy. The median age for of cases is 69 years (range, 1 month to 101 years). 47% of positive subjects were hospitalized. Among these, 18% required intensive care. The mean serial interval is estimated to be 6.6 days (95% CI, 0.7 to 19). We estimate the basic reproduction number at 3.1 (95% CI, 2.9 to 3.2). We estimated a decreasing trend in the net reproduction number starting around February 20, 2020. We did not observe significantly different viral loads in nasal swabs between symptomatic and asymptomatic. The transmission potential of COVID-19 is very high and the number of critical cases may become largely unsustainable for the healthcare system in a very short-time horizon. We observed a slight decrease of the reproduction number, possibly connected with an increased population awareness and early effect of interventions.

We present estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak.MethodsAccounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the estimated intrinsic growth rate (γ), we estimated R0 by using the serial intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true unknown SI.FindingsThe early outbreak data largely follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R0 ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96-2.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89-4.39) associated with 8-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate.

"RationaleSeveral studies have estimated basic production number of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). However, the time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP during the outbreak remain unclear.ObjectivesWe aimed to estimate the basic and time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP across China, and compared them with SARS.MethodsData on NCP cases by February 7, 2020 were collected from epidemiological investigations or official websites. Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases in Guangdong Province, Beijing and Hong Kong during 2002-2003 were also obtained. We estimated the doubling time, basic reproduction number (R0) and time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of NCP and SARS.Measurements and main resultsAs of February 7, 2020, 34,598 NCP cases were identified in China, and daily confirmed cases decreased after February 4. The doubling time of NCP nationwide was 2.4 days which was shorter than that of SARS in Guangdong (14.3 days), Hong Kong (5.7 days) and Beijing (12.4 days). TheR0of NCP cases nationwide and in Wuhan were 4.5 and 4.4 respectively, which were higher thanR0of SARS in Guangdong (R0=2.3), Hongkong (R0=2.3), and Beijing (R0=2.6). TheRtfor NCP continuously decreased especially after January 16 nationwide and in Wuhan. TheR0for secondary NCP cases in Guangdong was 0.6, and theRtvalues were less than 1 during the epidemic.ConclusionsNCP may have a higher transmissibility than SARS, and the efforts of containing the outbreak are effective.

"BackgroundAs the COVID-19 epidemic is spreading, incoming data allows us to quantify values of key variables that determine the transmission and the effort required to control the epidemic. We determine the incubation period and serial interval distribution for transmission clusters in Singapore and in Tianjin. We infer the basic reproduction number and identify the extent of pre-symptomatic transmission.MethodsWe collected outbreak information from Singapore and Tianjin, China, reported from Jan.19-Feb.26 and Jan.21-Feb.27, respectively. We estimated incubation periods and serial intervals in both populations.ResultsThe mean incubation period was 7.1 (6.13, 8.25) days for Singapore and 9 (7.92, 10.2) days for Tianjin. Both datasets had shorter incubation periods for earlier-occurring cases. The mean serial interval was 4.56 (2.69, 6.42) days for Singapore and 4.22 (3.43, 5.01) for Tianjin. We inferred that early in the outbreaks, infection was transmitted on average 2.55 and 2.89 days before symptom onset (Singapore, Tianjin). The estimated basic reproduction number for Singapore was 1.97 (1.45, 2.48) secondary cases per infective; for Tianjin it was 1.87 (1.65, 2.09) secondary cases per infective.ConclusionsEstimated serial intervals are shorter than incubation periods in both Singapore and Tianjin, suggesting that pre-symptomatic transmission is occurring. Shorter serial intervals lead to lower estimates of R0, which suggest that half of all secondary infections should be prevented to control spread.","['Caroline Colijn', 'Jacco Wallinga', 'Dongxuan Chen', 'Louxin Zhang', 'Yen-Hsiang Brian Lee', 'Manu Saraswat', 'Wing Yin Venus Lau', 'Emma Garlock', 'Jessica Stockdale', 'Michelle Coombe', 'Lauren Tindale']",10.1101/2020.03.03.20029983,http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.20029983,3,2020,Transmission interval estimates suggest pre-symptomatic spread of COVID-19,[],"([],)",,Virology
"BackgroundThe 2019 novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has been spreading rapidly in China. Decisions about its pandemic threat and the appropriate level of public health response depend heavily on estimates of its basic reproduction number and assessments of interventions conducted in the early stages of the epidemic.MethodsWe conducted a mathematical modeling study using five independent methods to assess the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19, using data on confirmed cases obtained from the China National Health Commission for the period 10th January – 8th February. We analyzed the data for the period before the closure of Wuhan city (10th January – 23rd January) and the post-closure period (23rd January – 8th February) and for the whole period, to assess both the epidemic risk of the virus and the effectiveness of the closure of Wuhan city on spread of COVID-19.FindingsBefore the closure of Wuhan city the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 was 4.38 (95% CI: 3.63 – 5.13), dropping to 3.41 (95% CI: 3.16 – 3.65) after the closure of Wuhan city. Over the entire epidemic period COVID-19 had a basic reproduction number of 3.39 (95% CI: 3.09 – 3.70), indicating it has a very high transmissibility.InterpretationCOVID-19 is a highly transmissible virus with a very high risk of epidemic outbreak once it emerges in metropolitan areas. The closure of Wuhan city was effective in reducing the severity of the epidemic, but even after closure of the city and the subsequent expansion of that closure to other parts of Hubei the virus remained extremely infectious.

"BackgroundIn December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, China and, later on, detected in other parts of China. Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the evolution of interventions and self-protection measures, estimate the risk of partial lifting control measures and predict the epidemic trend of the virus in mainland China excluding Hubei province based on the published data and a novel mathematical model.MethodsA novel COVID-19 transmission dynamic model incorporating the intervention measures implemented in China is proposed. COVID-19 daily data of mainland China excluding Hubei province, including the cumulative confirmed cases, the cumulative deaths, newly confirmed cases and the cumulative recovered cases for the period January 20th-March 3rd, 2020, were archived from the National Health Commission of China (NHCC). We parameterize the model by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and estimate the control reproduction number Rc, as well as the effective daily reproduction ratio Re(t), of the disease transmission in mainland China excluding Hubei province.ResultsThe estimation outcomes indicate that Rc is 3.36 (95% CI 3.20-3.64) and Re(t) has dropped below 1 since January 31st, 2020, which implies that the containment strategies implemented by the Chinese government in mainland China excluding Hubei province are indeed effective and magnificently suppressed COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, our results show that relieving personal protection too early may lead to the spread of disease for a longer time and more people would be infected, and may even cause epidemic or outbreak again. By calculating the effective reproduction ratio, we prove that the contact rate should be kept at least less than 30% of the normal level by April, 2020.ConclusionsTo ensure the epidemic ending rapidly, it is necessary to maintain the current integrated restrict interventions and self-protection measures, including travel restriction, quarantine of entry, contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation and reduction of contact, like wearing masks, etc. People should be fully aware of the real-time epidemic situation and keep sufficient personal protection until April.

We estimated the initial basic reproduction number for South Korea, the Guangdong province and mainland China as 2.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): (2.5, 2.7)), 3.0 (95%CI: (2.6, 3.3)) and 3.8 (95%CI: (3.5,4.2)), respectively, given a serial interval with mean of 5 days with standard deviation of 3 days. We found that the effective reproduction number for the Guangdong province and mainland China has fallen below the threshold 1 since February 8th and 18th respectively, while the effective reproduction number for South Korea remains high, suggesting that the interventions implemented need to be enhanced in order to halt further infections. We also project the epidemic trend in South Korea under different scenarios where a portion or the entirety of the integrated package of interventions in China is used. We show that a coherent and integrated approach with stringent public health interventions is the key to the success of containing the epidemic in China and specially its provinces outside its epicenter, and we show that this approach can also be effective to mitigate the burden of the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea.

"IntroductionSince December 29, 2019 a pandemic of new novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia named COVID-19 has started from Wuhan, China, has led to 254 996 confirmed cases until midday March 20, 2020. Sporadic cases have been imported worldwide, in Algeria, the first case reported on February 25, 2020 was imported from Italy, and then the epidemic has spread to other parts of the country very quickly with 139 confirmed cases until March 21, 2020.MethodsIt is crucial to estimate the cases number growth in the early stages of the outbreak, to this end, we have implemented the Alg-COVID-19 Model which allows to predict the incidence and the reproduction number R0 in the coming months in order to help decision makers.The Alg-COVIS-19 Model initial equation 1, estimates the cumulative cases at t prediction time using two parameters: the reproduction number R0 and the serial interval SI.ResultsWe found R0=2.55 based on actual incidence at the first 25 days, using the serial interval SI= 4,4 and the prediction time t=26. The herd immunity HI estimated is HI=61%. Also, The Covid-19 incidence predicted with the Alg-COVID-19 Model fits closely the actual incidence during the first 26 days of the epidemic in Algeria Fig. 1.A. which allows us to use it.According to Alg-COVID-19 Model, the number of cases will exceed 5000 on the 42th day (April 7th) and it will double to 10000 on 46th day of the epidemic (April 11th), thus, exponential phase will begin (Table 1; Fig.1.B) and increases continuously until reaching à herd immunity of 61% unless serious preventive measures are considered.DiscussionThis model is valid only when the majority of the population is vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, however, it can be updated to fit the new parameters values.",Mohamed HAMIDOUCHE,10.1101/2020.03.20.20039891,http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.20039891,3,2020,COVID-19 outbreak in Algeria: A mathematical model to predict the incidence,medRxiv,"([],)",,Virology
"BackgroundOn January 23, 2020, a quarantine was imposed on travel in and out of Wuhan, where the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak originated from. Previous analyses estimated the basic epidemiological parameters using symptom onset dates of the confirmed cases in Wuhan and outside China.MethodsWe obtained information on the 46 coronavirus cases who traveled from Wuhan before January 23 and have been subsequently confirmed in Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Macau, Singapore, and Taiwan as of February 5, 2020. Most cases have detailed travel history and disease progress. Compared to previous analyses, an important distinction is that we used this data to informatively simulate the infection time of each case using the symptom onset time, previously reported incubation interval, and travel history. We then fitted a simple exponential growth model with adjustment for the January 23 travel ban to the distribution of the simulated infection time. We used a Bayesian analysis with diffuse priors to quantify the uncertainty of the estimated epidemiological parameters. We performed sensitivity analysis to different choices of incubation interval and the hyperparameters in the prior specification.ResultsWe found that our model provides good fit to the distribution of the infection time. Assuming the travel rate to the selected countries and regions is constant over the study period, we found that the epidemic was doubling in size every 2.9 days (95% credible interval [CrI], 2 days—4.1 days). Using previously reported serial interval for 2019-nCoV, the estimated basic reproduction number is 5.7 (95% CrI, 3.4—9.2). The estimates did not change substantially if we assumed the travel rate doubled in the last 3 days before January 23, when we used previously reported incubation interval for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or when we changed the hyperparameters in our prior specification.ConclusionsOur estimated epidemiological parameters are higher than an earlier report using confirmed cases in Wuhan.

"The exported cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection that were confirmed outside China provide an opportunity to estimate the cumulative incidence and confirmed case fatality risk (cCFR) in mainland China. Knowledge of the cCFR is critical to characterize the severity and understand the pandemic potential of COVID-19 in the early stage of the epidemic. Using the exponential growth rate of the incidence, the present study statistically estimated the cCFR and the basic reproduction number—the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a naïve population. We modeled epidemic growth either from a single index case with illness onset on 8 December 2019 (Scenario 1), or using the growth rate fitted along with the other parameters (Scenario 2) based on data from 20 exported cases reported by 24 January 2020.

"Background: In December 2019, an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread to other parts of China and a number of foreign countries. The 2019-nCoV cases might have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV. Methods: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth. The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation. We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for 2019-nCoV to estimate R0. Results: We confirmed that the initial growth phase followed an exponential growth pattern. The under-reporting was likely to have resulted in 469 (95% CI: 403–540) unreported cases from 1 to 15 January 2020. The reporting rate after 17 January 2020 was likely to have increased 21-fold (95% CI: 18–25) in comparison to the situation from 1 to 17 January 2020 on average. We estimated the R0 of 2019-nCoV at 2.56 (95% CI: 2.49–2.63). Conclusion: The under-reporting was likely to have occurred during the first half of January 2020 and should be considered in future investigation.","['Maggie H.

"Since the emergence of the first cases in Wuhan, China, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has been quickly spreading out to other provinces and neighboring countries. Estimation of the basic reproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity. A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures. The estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71–7.23). Sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019-nCoV infection in Beijing being almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value. It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures implemented by the Chinese authorities can contribute to the prevention and control of the 2019-nCoV infection, and how long they should be maintained. Under the most restrictive measures, the outbreak is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020) with a significant low peak value. With travel restriction (no imported exposed individuals to Beijing), the number of infected individuals in seven days will decrease by 91.14% in Beijing, compared with the scenario of no travel restriction.","['Wu, Jianhong', 'Xiao, Yanni', 'Sanyi Tang', 'Nicola Luigi Bragazzi', 'Li, Qian', 'Wang, Xia', 'Tang, Biao']",10.3390/jcm9020462,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jcm9020462,2,2020,Estimation of the Transmission Risk of the 2019-nCoV and Its Implication for Public Health Interventions,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"(['General Medicine'],)",,Virology

We develop a ‘mechanistic-statistical’ approach coupling a SIR epidemiological model describing the unobserved epidemiological dynamics, a probabilistic model describing the data acquisition process and a statistical inference method.

First, division of the cumulative number of deaths by that of cases tends to underestimate the actual risk because deaths that will occur have not yet observed, and so the delay in time from illness onset to death must be addressed. Second, the observed dataset of reported cases represents only a proportion of all infected individuals and there can be a substantial number of asymptomatic and mildly infected individuals who are never diagnosed. Third, ascertainment bias and risk of death among all those infected would be smaller when estimated using shorter virus detection windows and less sensitive diagnostic laboratory tests. In the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, health authorities must cope with the uncertainty in the risk of death from COVID-19, and high-risk individuals should be identified using approaches that can address the abovementioned three problems. Although COVID-19 involves mostly mild infections among the majority of the general population, the risk of death among young adults is higher than that of seasonal influenza, and elderly with underlying comorbidities require additional care.","['Hiroshi Nishiura', 'Suzuki, Ayako', 'Andrei R.

"BackgroundThe epidemic outbreak cased by coronavirus 2019-nCoV is of great interest to researches because of the high rate of spread of the infection and the significant number of fatalities. A detailed scientific analysis of the phenomenon is yet to come, but the public is already interested in the questions of the duration of the epidemic, the expected number of patients and deaths. For long time predictions, the complicated mathematical models are necessary which need many efforts for unknown parameters identification and calculations. In this article, some preliminary estimates will be presented.ObjectiveSince the reliable long time data are available only for mainland China, we will try to predict the epidemic characteristics only in this area. We will estimate some of the epidemic characteristics and present the most reliable dependences for victim numbers, infected and removed persons versus time.MethodsIn this study we use the known SIR model for the dynamics of an epidemic, the known exact solution of the linear equations and statistical approach developed before for investigation of the children disease, which occurred in Chernivtsi (Ukraine) in 1988-1989.ResultsThe optimal values of the SIR model parameters were identified with the use of statistical approach. The numbers of infected, susceptible and removed persons versus time were predicted.ConclusionsSimple mathematical model was used to predict the characteristics of the epidemic caused by coronavirus 2019-nCoV in mainland China. The further research should focus on updating the predictions with the use of fresh data and using more complicated mathematical models.",Igor Nesteruk,10.1101/2020.02.12.20021931,https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20021931v1,2,2020,Statistics based predictions of coronavirus 2019-nCoV spreading in mainland China,medRxiv 2020,"([],)",,Virology
"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which originated in Wuhan, China, constitutes a public health emergency of international concern with a very high risk of spread and impact at the global level. We developed data-driven susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantine-recovered (SEIQR) models to simulate the epidemic with the interventions of social distancing and epicenter lockdown. Population migration data combined with officially reported data were used to estimate model parameters, and then calculated the daily exported infected individuals by estimating the daily infected ratio and daily susceptible population size. As of Jan 01, 2020, the estimated initial number of latently infected individuals was 380.1 (95%-CI: 379.8∼381.0). With 30 days of substantial social distancing, the reproductive number in Wuhan and Hubei was reduced from 2.2 (95%-CI: 1.4∼3.9) to 1.58 (95%-CI: 1.34∼2.07), and in other provinces from 2.56 (95%-CI: 2.43∼2.63) to 1.65 (95%-CI: 1.56∼1.76). We found that earlier intervention of social distancing could significantly limit the epidemic in mainland China. The number of infections could be reduced up to 98.9%, and the number of deaths could be reduced by up to 99.3% as of Feb 23, 2020. However, earlier epicenter lockdown would partially neutralize this favorable effect. Because it would cause in situ deteriorating, which overwhelms the improvement out of the epicenter. To minimize the epidemic size and death, stepwise implementation of social distancing in the epicenter city first, then in the province, and later the whole nation without the epicenter lockdown would be practical and cost-effective.","['Yanyun Tao', 'Jiamin Yuan', 'Bin Jiang', 'Yuzhen Zhang']",10.1101/2020.03.04.20031187,http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031187,3,2020,The impact of social distancing and epicenter lockdown on the COVID-19 epidemic in mainland China: A data-driven SEIQR model study,medRxiv,"([],)",,Virology

We estimated incubation periods and serial intervals in both populations.ResultsThe mean incubation period was 7.1 (6.13, 8.25) days for Singapore and 9 (7.92, 10.2) days for Tianjin. Both datasets had shorter incubation periods for earlier-occurring cases. The mean serial interval was 4.56 (2.69, 6.42) days for Singapore and 4.22 (3.43, 5.01) for Tianjin. We inferred that early in the outbreaks, infection was transmitted on average 2.55 and 2.89 days before symptom onset (Singapore, Tianjin). The estimated basic reproduction number for Singapore was 1.97 (1.45, 2.48) secondary cases per infective; for Tianjin it was 1.87 (1.65, 2.09) secondary cases per infective.ConclusionsEstimated serial intervals are shorter than incubation periods in both Singapore and Tianjin, suggesting that pre-symptomatic transmission is occurring.

Epidemiological data were collected through standardized interviews of confirmed cases and their close contacts.

"Social ties are crucial for humans. Disruption of ties through social exclusion has a marked effect on our thoughts and feelings; however, such effects can be tempered by broader social network resources. Here, we use fMRI data acquired from 80 male adolescents to investigate how social exclusion modulates functional connectivity within and across brain networks involved in social pain and understanding the mental states of others (i.e., mentalizing). Furthermore, using objectively logged friendship network data, we examine how individual variability in brain reactivity to social exclusion relates to the density of participants’ friendship networks, an important aspect of social network structure. We find increased connectivity within a set of regions previously identified as a mentalizing system during exclusion relative to inclusion. These results are consistent across the regions of interest as well as a whole-brain analysis. Next, examining how social network characteristics are associated with task-based connectivity dynamics, we find that participants who showed greater changes in connectivity within the mentalizing system when socially excluded by peers had less dense friendship networks. This work provides insight to understand how distributed brain systems respond to social and emotional challenges and how such brain dynamics might vary based on broader social network characteristics.","['Emily B.

"Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 deficiency (ALDH2*2) causes facial flushing in response to alcohol consumption in approximately 560 million East Asians. Recent meta-analysis demonstrated the potential link between ALDH2*2 mutation and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Other studies have linked chronic alcohol consumption as a risk factor for AD. In the present study, we show that fibroblasts of an AD patient that also has an ALDH2*2 mutation or overexpression of ALDH2*2 in fibroblasts derived from AD patients harboring ApoE ε4 allele exhibited increased aldehydic load, oxidative stress, and increased mitochondrial dysfunction relative to healthy subjects and exposure to ethanol exacerbated these dysfunctions. In an in vivo model, daily exposure of WT mice to ethanol for 11 weeks resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and increased aldehyde levels in their brains and these pathologies were greater in ALDH2*2/*2 (homozygous) mice. Following chronic ethanol exposure, the levels of the AD-associated protein, amyloid-β, and neuroinflammation were higher in the brains of the ALDH2*2/*2 mice relative to WT. Cultured primary cortical neurons of ALDH2*2/*2 mice showed increased sensitivity to ethanol and there was a greater activation of their primary astrocytes relative to the responses of neurons or astrocytes from the WT mice. Importantly, an activator of ALDH2 and ALDH2*2, Alda-1, blunted the ethanol-induced increases in Aβ, and the neuroinflammation in vitro and in vivo. These data indicate that impairment in the metabolism of aldehydes, and specifically ethanol-derived acetaldehyde, is a contributor to AD associated pathology and highlights the likely risk of alcohol consumption in the general population and especially in East Asians that carry ALDH2*2 mutation.","['Daria Mochly-Rosen', 'Che-Hong Chen', 'Kenneth I.

"MERS-CoV uses the S1            B            domain of its spike protein to attach to its host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). The tissue localization of DPP4 has been mapped in different susceptible species. On the other hand, the S1            A            domain, the N-terminal domain of this spike protein, preferentially binds to several glycotopes of α2,3-sialic acids, the attachment factor of MERS-CoV. Here we show, using a novel method, that the S1            A            domain specifically binds to the nasal epithelium of dromedary camels, alveolar epithelium of humans, and intestinal epithelium of common pipistrelle bats. In contrast, it does not bind to the nasal epithelium of pigs or rabbits, nor does it bind to the intestinal epithelium of serotine bats and frugivorous bat species. This finding supports the importance of the S1            A            domain in MERS-CoV infection and tropism, suggests its role in transmission, and highlights its potential use as a component of novel vaccine candidates.","['Bart L Haagmans', 'Berend-Jan Bosch', 'Judith M A van den Brand', 'Lineke Begeman', 'Rik L de Swart', 'Alwin de Jong', 'Wentao Li', 'Nisreen M A Okba', 'W Widagdo']",10.1128/JVI.00107-19,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00107-19,7,2019,Species-Specific Colocalization of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Attachment and Entry Receptors,['Journal of Virology'],"(['Virology', 'Insect Science', 'Immunology', 'Microbiology'],)",,Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmaceutics
"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) targets the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract both in humans and in its natural host, the dromedary camel. Virion attachment to host cells is mediated by 20-nm-long homotrimers of spike envelope protein S. The N-terminal subunit of each S protomer, called S1, folds into four distinct domains designated S1A through S1D. Binding of MERS-CoV to the cell surface entry receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) occurs via S1B. We now demonstrate that in addition to DPP4, MERS-CoV binds to sialic acid (Sia). Initially demonstrated by hemagglutination assay with human erythrocytes and intact virus, MERS-CoV Sia-binding activity was assigned to S subdomain S1A. When multivalently displayed on nanoparticles, S1 or S1A bound to human erythrocytes and to human mucin in a strictly Sia-dependent fashion. Glycan array analysis revealed a preference for α2,3-linked Sias over α2,6-linked Sias, which correlates with the differential distribution of α2,3-linked Sias and the predominant sites of MERS-CoV replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of camels and humans, respectively. Binding is hampered by Sia modifications such as 5-N-glycolylation and (7,)9-O-acetylation. Depletion of cell surface Sia by neuraminidase treatment inhibited MERS-CoV entry of Calu-3 human airway cells, thus providing direct evidence that virus–Sia interactions may aid in virion attachment. The combined observations lead us to propose that high-specificity, low-affinity attachment of MERS-CoV to sialoglycans during the preattachment or early attachment phase may form another determinant governing the host range and tissue tropism of this zoonotic pathogen.","['Berend-Jan Bosch', 'Bart L Haagmans', 'Frank J M van Kuppeveld', 'Raoul J de Groot', 'Cornelis A M de Haan', 'James C Paulson', 'Jan W M van Lent', 'Yifei Lang', 'Brenda van Dieren', 'M Alejandra Tortorici', 'W Widagdo', 'Wenjie Peng', 'Ryan McBride', 'V Stalin Raj', 'Ivy Widjaja', 'Ruben J G Hulswit', 'Wentao Li']",10.1073/pnas.1712592114,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1712592114,10,2017,Identification of sialic acid-binding function for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike glycoprotein,['Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'],"(['Multidisciplinary'],)",,Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmaceutics

Because of their small size, nanobodies (Nbs) have advantages as antiviral therapeutics (e.g., high expression yield and robustness for storage and transportation) and also potential limitations (e.g., low antigen-binding affinity and fast renal clearance). Here, we have developed novel Nbs that specifically target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV spike protein. They bind to a conserved site on MERS-CoV RBD with high affinity, blocking RBD's binding to MERS-CoV receptor. Through engineering a C-terminal human Fc tag, the            in vivo            half-life of the Nbs is significantly extended. Moreover, the Nbs can potently cross-neutralize the infections of diverse MERS-CoV strains isolated from humans and camels.

We generated two oligomeric Nbs by linking two or three monomeric Nbs (Mono-Nbs) targeting the MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD), and compared their RBD-binding affinity, RBD–receptor binding inhibition, stability, and neutralizing and cross-neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV. Relative to Mono-Nb, dimeric Nb (Di-Nb) and trimeric Nb (Tri-Nb) had significantly greater ability to bind MERS-CoV RBD proteins with or without mutations in the RBD, thereby potently blocking RBD–MERS-CoV receptor binding. The engineered oligomeric Nbs were very stable under extreme conditions, including low or high pH, protease (pepsin), chaotropic denaturant (urea), and high temperature. Importantly, Di-Nb and Tri-Nb exerted significantly elevated broad-spectrum neutralizing activity against at least 19 human and camel MERS-CoV strains isolated in different countries and years. Overall, the engineered Nbs could be developed into effective therapeutic agents for prevention and treatment of MERS-CoV infection.","['Guangyu Zhao', 'Lanying Du', 'Yusen Zhou', 'Shihui Sun', 'Junfeng Li', 'Yaning Gao', 'Yuehong Chen', 'Jiangfan Li', 'Wanbo Tai', 'Lei He']",10.3390/v11020166,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v11020166,2,2019,Enhanced Ability of Oligomeric Nanobodies Targeting MERS Coronavirus Receptor-Binding Domain,['Viruses'],"(['Virology', 'Infectious Diseases'],)",,Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmaceutics

"Background: Oral administrations of microparticles (MPs) and nanoparticles (NPs) havebeen widely employed as therapeutic approaches for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). However,no previous study has comparatively investigated the therapeutic efficacies of MPs and NPs.Methods: In this study, curcumin (CUR)-loaded MPs (CUR-MPs) and CUR-loaded NPs (CUR-NPs)were prepared using a single water-in-oil emulsion solvent evaporation technique. Their therapeuticoutcomes against UC were further comparatively studied.Results: The resultant spherical MPs and NPs exhibited slightly negative zeta-potential with averageparticle diameters of approximately 1.7 &amp;#181;m and 270 nm, respectively. It was found that NPs exhibiteda much higher CUR release rate than MPs within the same period of investigation. In vivo experimentsdemonstrated that oral administration of CUR-MPs and CUR-NPs reduced the symptomsof inflammation in a UC mouse model induced by dextran sulfate sodium. Importantly, CUR-NPsshowed much better therapeutic outcomes in alleviating UC compared with CUR-MPs.Conclusion: NPs can improve the anti-inflammatory activity of CUR by enhancing the drug releaseand cellular uptake efficiency, in comparison with MPs. Thus, they could be exploited as a promisingoral drug delivery system for effective UC treatment.","['Bo Xiao', 'Jianglin Wang', 'Yuejun Kang', 'Zhigang Xu', 'Meili Hou', 'Lijun Ma', 'Qiubing Chen', 'Xiaoying Si', 'Panpan Ma']",10.2174/1568009618666181016152042,http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/1568009618666181016152042,3,2019,Oral Drug Delivery Systems for Ulcerative Colitis Therapy: A Comparative Study with Microparticles and Nanoparticles,Current Cancer Drug Targets,"(['Cancer Research', 'Drug Discovery', 'Pharmacology', 'Oncology'],)",,Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmaceutics

"Background:Paclitaxel (PTX) is one of the most important and effective anticancer drugs forthe treatment of human cancer. However, its low solubility and severe adverse effects limited clinicaluse. To overcome this limitation, nanotechnology has been used to overcome tumors due to its excellentantimicrobial activity.Objective:This study was to demonstrate the anticancer properties of functionalization silver nanoparticlesloaded with paclitaxel (Ag@PTX) induced A549 cells apoptosis through ROS-mediated signalingpathways.Methods: The Ag@PTX nanoparticles were charged with a zeta potential of about -17 mv and characterizedaround 2 nm with a narrow size distribution.Results:Ag@PTX significantly decreased the viability of A549 cells and possessed selectivity betweencancer and normal cells. Ag@PTX induced A549 cells apoptosis was confirmed by nuclear condensation,DNA fragmentation, and activation of caspase-3. Furthermore, Ag@PTX enhanced the anti-canceractivity of A549 cells through ROS-mediated p53 and AKT signalling pathways. Finally, in a xenograftnude mice model, Ag@PTX suppressed the growth of tumors.Conclusion:Our findings suggest that Ag@PTX may be a candidate as a chemopreventive agent andcould be a highly efficient way to achieve anticancer synergism for human cancers.","['Yinghua Li', 'Bing Zhu', 'Jianjun Zou']",10.2174/1568026619666191019102219,http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/1568026619666191019102219,2,2020,Functionalization of Silver Nanoparticles Loaded with Paclitaxel-induced A549 Cells Apoptosis Through ROS-Mediated Signaling Pathways,Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry,"(['Drug Discovery', 'General Medicine'],)",,Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmaceutics

The NOAEC in both species is 25 ml/m3. Elastane fibre workers with exposure to N,N‐dimethylacetamide show hepatocellular injury. The data at the workplace is not adequate to derive a MAK value. The former MAK value of 10 ml/m3 was derived from the NOAEC of 25 ml/m3 in rats and mice. The MAK value is now lowered to 5 ml/m3 which takes into account the increased respiratory volume at the workplace because the blood:air partition coefficient of N,N‐dimethylacetamide is > 5 (see List of MAK and BAT Values, Sections I b and I c). Since a systemic effect is critical, Peak Limitation Category II is retained. The default excursion factor of 2 is retained as well, as the mechanism of action and the half‐life in blood are not known.  In rats and rabbits, N,N‐dimethylacetamide induces via inhalation at 450 or 570 ml/m3, respectively, and above, specific teratogenic effects, cardiovascular and skeletal malformations. The NOAEC for teratogenicity in rats and rabbits are 300 or 200 ml/m3, respectively. The lowest NOAEC for developmental toxicity in rats and rabbits are 100 and 57 ml/m3, respectively. Considering the increased respiratory volume at the workplace, the NOAEC for rabbits is only six times the MAK value. However, taking into account that the NOAEC could be higher than 57 ml/m3 and the observed effects, reduced fetal body weight and increased incidence of skeletal variations, are considered marginal, the difference to the MAK value is sufficient. Therefore, damage to the embryo or foetus is unlikely when the MAK value is observed and N,N‐dimethylacetamide remains assigned to Pregnancy Risk Group C. Skin contact should be avoided as N,N‐dimethylacetamide is designated with an “H”.","['MAK Comission', 'Andrea Hartwig']",10.1002/3527600418.mb12719e6519,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e123513736b4d38a82ef03e20a14dec1dc258a52,10,2019,"N,N‐Dimethylacetamide [MAK Value Documentation, 2018]","The MAK Collection for Occupational Health and Safety 2019, Vol 4, No 4",,,Toxicology

"Achieving and maintaining high standards of animal welfare is critical to the success of a modern zoo. Research has shown that an animal’s welfare is highly dependent on how various individual animal factors (e.g., species traits, genetics, temperament and previous experience) interact with environmental features (e.g., social grouping, enclosure design and sensory environment). One prominent feature of the zoo environment is the presence of visitors. Visitor contact can be unpredictable and intense, particularly in terms of auditory and visual interaction. Depending on an animal’s perception of this interaction, visitors can have either negative, neutral or positive impacts on zoo animal behaviour and welfare. This paper reviews the literature on the implications and potential opportunities of human-zoo animal interactions on animal behaviour and welfare, with the aim of stimulating interest, understanding and exploration of this important subject. The literature to date presents a mixed range of findings on the topic. It is possible this variation in the responses of zoo animals to visitors may be due to species-specific differences, the nature and intensity of the visitor interactions, enclosure design, and individual animal characteristics. Analysing these studies and better understanding animal preferences and motivations can provide insight into what animals find negatively and positively reinforcing in terms of visitor contact in a specific zoo setting. This understanding can then be applied to either safeguard welfare in cases where visitors can have a negative impact, or, conversely, it can be applied to highlight opportunities to encourage animal-visitor interaction in situations where animals experience positive emotions associated with visitor interaction.","['Paul H.

"We report an evaluation of the treatment and outcome of cats with suspected primary epilepsy. Phenobarbital therapy was used alone or in combination with other anti-epileptic drugs. Outcome after treatment was evaluated mainly on the basis of number of seizures per year and categorised into four groups: seizure-free, good control (1–5 seizures per year), moderate control (6–10 seizures per year) and poor control (more than 10 seizures per year). About 40–50% of cases became seizure-free, 20–30% were considered good-to-moderately controlled and about 30% were poorly controlled depending on the year of treatment considered. The duration of seizure events after treatment decreased in 26/36 cats and was unchanged in eight cats. The subjective severity of seizure also decreased in 25 cats and was unchanged in nine cats. Twenty-six cats had a good quality of life, nine cats an impaired quality of life and one cat a bad quality of life. Despite being free of seizures for years, cessation of treatment may lead to recurrence of seizures in most cats.","['Johann G. Thalhammer', 'Peter Halasz', 'Alexander G.

"Seven cats were presented for mild-to-moderate cough and/or dyspnoea after starting bromide (Br) therapy for neurological diseases. The thoracic auscultation was abnormal in three cats showing increased respiratory sounds and wheezes. Haematology revealed mild eosinophilia in one cat. The thoracic radiographs showed bronchial patterns with peribronchial cuffing in most of them. Bronchoalveolar lavage performed in two cats revealed neutrophilic and eosinophilic inflammation. Histopathology conducted in one cat showed endogenous lipid pneumonia (EnLP). All cats improved with steroid therapy after Br discontinuation. Five cats were completely weaned off steroids, with no recurrence of clinical signs. In one cat, the treatment was discontinued despite persistent clinical signs. The cat presenting with EnLP developed secondary pneumothorax and did not recover. Br-associated lower airway disease can appear in cats after months of treatment and clinical improvement occurs only after discontinuing Br therapy.","[' Alexandra Gabriel', ' Agnès Poujade', 'Laurent Cauzinille', 'Eymeric Gomes', 'Juan Hernandez', 'Coralie Bertolani']",10.1177/1098612X12445069,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1098612x12445069,4,2012,Bromide-associated lower airway disease: a retrospective study of seven cats, Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery,"(['Small Animals'],)",,Animal Sciences

"Acute fulminant hepatic necrosis was associated with repeated oral administration of diazepam (1.25 to 2 mg, PO, q 24 or 12 h), prescribed for behavioral modification or to facilitate urination. Five of 11 cats became lethargic, atactic, and anorectic within 96 hours of initial treatment. All cats became jaundiced during the first 11 days of illness. Serum biochemical analysis revealed profoundly high alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase activities. Results of coagulation tests in 3 cats revealed marked abnormalities. Ten cats died or were euthanatized within 15 days of initial drug administration, and only 1 cat survived. Histologic evaluation of hepatic tissue specimens from each cat revealed florid centrilobular hepatic necrosis, profound biliary ductule proliferation and hyperplasia, and suppurative intraductal inflammation. Idiosyncratic hepatotoxicosis was suspected because of the rarity of this condition. Prior sensitization to diazepam was possible in only 1 cat, and consistent risk factors that could explain susceptibility to drug toxicosis were not identified. On the basis of the presumption that diazepam was hepatotoxic in these cats, an increase in serum transaminase activity within 5 days of treatment initiation indicates a need to suspend drug administration and to provide supportive care.

"Seizures are a common cause of neurologic disease, and phenobarbital (PB) is the most commonly used antiepileptic drug. Chronic oral dosing can be challenging for cat owners, leading to poor compliance. The purpose of this study was to determine if the transdermal administration of PB could achieve serum PB concentrations of between 15 and 45 μg/ml in healthy cats. Nineteen healthy cats were enrolled in three groups. Transdermal PB in pluronic lecithin organogel (PLO) was applied to the pinnae for 14 days at a dosage of 3 mg/kg q12h in group 1 (n = 6 cats) and 9 mg/kg q12h in group 2 (n = 7 cats). Transdermal PB in Lipoderm Activemax was similarly applied at 9 mg/kg q12h for 14 days in group 3 (n = 6 cats). Steady-state serum PB concentrations were measured at trough, and at 2, 4 and 6 h after the morning dose on day 15. In group 1, median concentrations ranged from 6.0–7.5 μg/ml throughout the day (observed range 0–11 μg/ml). Group 2 median concentrations were 26.0 μg/ml (observed range 18.0–37.0 μg/ml). For group 3, median concentrations ranged from 15.0–17.0 μg/ml throughout the day (range 5–29 μg/ml). Side effects were mild. One cat was withdrawn from group 2 owing to ataxia and sedation. These results show therapeutic serum PB concentrations can be achieved in cats following chronic transdermal administration of PB in PLO at a dosage of 9 mg/kg q12h. More individual variation was noted using Lipoderm Activemax. Transdermal administration may be an alternative for cats that are difficult to medicate orally.","['Lauren Trepanier', 'Michelle Robertson', 'Heidi Barnes Heller', ' Joy A.

"With the eventual goal of making zonisamide (ZNS), a relatively new antiepileptic drug, available for the treatment of epilepsy in cats, the pharmacokinetics after a single oral administration at 10 mg/kg and the toxicity after 9-week daily administration of 20 mg/kg/day of ZNS were studied in healthy cats. Pharmacokinetic parameters obtained with a single administration of ZNS at 10 mg/day were as follows: Cmax=13.1 μg/ml; Tmax=4.0 h; T1/2=33.0 h; areas under the curves (AUCs)=720.3 μg/mlh (values represent the medians). The study with daily administrations revealed that the toxicity of ZNS was comparatively low in cats, suggesting that it may be an available drug for cats.

"Objectives The effectiveness of zonisamide (ZNS) against spontaneous epilepsy in cats has not yet been described. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of ZNS on interictal paroxysmal discharges (PDs) using scalp electroencephalography (EEG) in familial spontaneous epileptic cats (FSECs). Methods Eight FSECs were evaluated (six males and two females). Scalp EEG measurements were performed once a week for 3 weeks before ZNS administration (Pre-ZNS). Thereafter, administration of ZNS was started and an adjustment period was instituted until the drug in plasma achieved the steady state. When ZNS in plasma was confirmed to be within 10–40 μg/ml, scalp EEG measurements were performed once a week for 3 weeks (Post-ZNS). The number of PDs (counts/min) were compared between Pre-ZNS and Post-ZNS treatment. Results The median number of PDs for Pre-ZNS and Post-ZNS were 0.43/min (0.13–0.82/min) and 0.28/min (0.07–0.87/min), respectively. The number of PDs Post-ZNS was significantly reduced compared with Pre-ZNS ( P = 0.02). Conclusions and relevance This study showed that ZNS, within the recommended therapeutic range suggested for use in humans and dogs (10–40 µg/ml), reduced the number of PDs recorded on EEG in FSECs that are considered a model for cats with idiopathic epilepsy. Although phenobarbital is the antiepileptic drug of choice for epileptic cats, the results of this research provide evidence to support the use of ZNS in cats with phenobarbital-resistant epilepsy or for cats that cannot use phenobarbital due to adverse side effects.","['Daisuke Hasegawa', 'Michio Fujita', 'Aki Fujiwara-Igarashi', 'Yoshihiko Yu', 'Yuji Hamamoto', 'Masayasu Ukai']",10.1177/1098612X17740247,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1098612x17740247,11,2017,Efficacy of zonisamide on interictal electroencephalography in familial spontaneous epileptic cats, Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery,"(['Small Animals'],)",,Animal Sciences

"Objectives Currently, there are no published randomised, controlled veterinary trials evaluating the efficacy of antiepileptic medication in the treatment of myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures are a hallmark of feline audiogenic seizures (FARS). Methods This prospective, randomised, open-label trial compared the efficacy and tolerability of levetiracetam (20–25 mg/kg q8h) with phenobarbital (3–5 mg/kg q12h) in cats with suspected FARS that experienced myoclonic seizures. Cats were included that had ⩾12 myoclonic seizure days during a prospective 12 week baseline period. This was followed by a 4 week titration phase (until a therapeutic serum concentration of phenobarbital was achieved) and a 12 week treatment phase. Results Fifty-seven cats completed the study: 28 in the levetiracetam group and 29 in the phenobarbital group. A reduction of ⩾50% in the number of myoclonic seizure days was seen in 100% of patients in the levetiracetam group and in 3% of patients in the phenobarbital group ( P &lt;0.001) during the treatment period. Levetiracetam-treated cats had higher freedom from myoclonic seizures (50.0% vs 0%; P &lt;0.001) during the treatment period. The most common adverse events were lethargy, inappetence and ataxia, with no difference in incidence between levetiracetam and phenobarbital. Adverse events were mild and transient with levetiracetam but persistent with phenobarbital. Conclusions and relevance These results suggest that levetiracetam is an effective and well tolerated treatment for cats with myoclonic seizures and is more effective than phenobarbital. Whether it will prevent the occurrence of generalised tonic–clonic seizures and other forebrain signs if used early in the course of FARS is not yet clear.","['Laurent Garosi', 'Robert Harvey', 'Andrew Sparkes', ' Claire Bessant', 'Sarah Thomson', 'Mark Lowrie']",10.1177/1098612X15622806 ,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1098612x15622806,1,2017,"Levetiracetam in the management of feline audiogenic reflex seizures: a randomised, controlled, open-label study", Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery,"(['Small Animals'],)",,Animal Sciences

"Members of the genus Treron (Columbidae) are widely distributed in southern Asia and the Indo-Malayan Region but their relationships are poorly understood. Better knowledge of the systematic status of this genus may help studies of historical biogeography and taxonomy. The complete mitochondrial genome of T. curvirostra was characterized, a first for the genus. It is 17,414 base pairs in length, containing two rRNAs, 22 tRNAs, 13 protein coding genes (PCGs), and one D-loop with a primary structure that is similar to that found in most members of Columbidae. Most PCGs start with the common ATG codon but are terminated by different codons. The highest value of the Ka/Ks ratio within 13 PCGs was found in ATP8 with 0.1937, suggesting that PCGs of the mitochondrial genome tend to be conservative in Columbidae. Moreover, the phylogenetic relationships within Columbidae, which was based on sequences of 13 PCGs, showed that (T. curvirostra + Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae) were clustered in one clade, suggesting a potentially close relationship between Treron and Hemiphaga. However, the monophyly of the subfamilies of Columbidae recognized by the Interagency Taxonomic Information System could not be corroborated. Hence, the position of the genus Treron in the classification of Columbidae may have to be revised.","['Hongyi Liu', 'Wentao Ye', 'Wei Xu', 'Ziting Que', 'Jiayu Ding', 'Nan Xu']",10.3897/zookeys.1041.60150,http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.1041.60150,6,2021,"The mitochondrial genome and phylogenetic characteristics of the Thick-billed Green-Pigeon, Treron curvirostra: the first sequence for the genus",ZooKeys,"(['Animal Science and Zoology', 'Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics'],)",,Zoology
"An optimization study of the mix ratio for substitution of Wheat flour with Cassava and African Yam Bean flours (AYB) was carried out and reported in this paper. The aim was to obtain a mix ratio that would optimise selected physical properties of the bread. Wheat flour was substituted with Cassava and African Yam Bean flours at different levels: 80% to 100% of wheat, 0% to 10% of cassava flour and 0% to 10% for AYB flour. The experiment was conducted in mixture design which was generated and analysed by Design-Expert Software 11 version. The Composite dough was prepared in different mix ratios according to the design matrix and subsequentlybaked under the same conditions and analysed for the following loaf quality attributes: Loaf Specific Volume, Bread Crumb Hardness and Crumb Colour Index as response variables. The objective functions were to maximize Loaf Specific Volume, minimize Wheat flour, Bread Crumb Hardness and Crumb Colour Index to obtain the most suitable substitution ratio acceptable to  consumers. Predictive models for the response variables were developed with the coefficient of determination (R2 ) of 0.991 for Loaf Specific Volume (LSV) while that of Bread Crumb Hardness (BCH) and Crumb Colour Index (CCI) were 0.834 and 0.895 respectively at 95% confidence interval (CI).The predicted optimal substitution ratio was obtained as follows: 88% Wheat flour, 10% Cassava flour, and 2% AYB flour. At this formulation, the predicted Loaf Specific Volume was 2.11cm3 /g, Bread Crumb Hardness was 25.12N, and Crumb Colour Index was 18.88.The study shows that addition of 2% of AYB flour in the formulation would help to optimise the LSV, BCH and the CCI of the Wheat-Cassava flour bread at the mix ratio of 88:10. Application of the results of this study in bread industries will reduce the cost of bread in Nigeria, which is influenced by the rising cost of imported wheat. This is a significant development because wheat flour was the sole baking flour in Nigeria before wheat substitution initiative.&#x0D;Keywords: Bread, wheat, Cassava, African Yam Bean, Flour, Dough, Loaf Specific Volume, Crumb Hardness, Crumb Colour Index","['A.B.

The aim of this work was to study the influence of the pulsed electric field (PEF) at different electric field strengths (4.38 and 6.25 kV/cm), pulse number 10–30, and energy input 0–12.5 kJ/kg as a pretreatment method on the extraction of betalains from beetroot. The obtained results showed that the application of PEF pre-treatment significantly (p &lt; 0.05) influenced the efficiency of extraction of bioactive compounds from beetroot. The highest increase in the content of betalain compounds in the red beet’s extract (betanin by 329%, vulgaxanthin by 244%, compared to the control sample), was noted for 20 pulses of electric field at 4.38 kV/cm of strength. Treatment of the plant material with a PEF also resulted in an increase in the electrical conductivity compared to the non-treated sample due to the increase in cell membrane permeability, which was associated with leakage of substances able to conduct electricity, including mineral salts, into the intercellular space.","['Urszula Tylewicz', 'Dorota Witrowa-Rajchert', 'Kinga Drozdzal', 'Jakub Czyzewski', 'Agnieszka Miszczykowska', 'Katarzyna Rybak', 'Artur Wiktor', 'Silvia Tappi', 'Malgorzata Nowacka']",10.3390/foods8070244,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods8070244,7,2019,The Impact of Pulsed Electric Field on the Extraction of Bioactive Compounds from Beetroot,Foods,"(['Plant Science', 'Health Professions (miscellaneous)', 'Health(social science)', 'Microbiology', 'Food Science'],)",,Food Processing

"Iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) has been a major global public health problem threatening more than 2 billion people worldwide. Considering various human health implications associated with iodine deficiency, universal salt iodization programme has been recognized as one of the best methods of preventing iodine deficiency disorder and iodizing table salt is currently done in many countries. In this study, comparative assessment of iodine content of commercially available table salt brands in Nigerian market were investigated and iodine content were measured in ten table salt brands samples using iodometric titration. The iodine content ranged from 14.80 mg/kg – 16.90 mg/kg with mean value of 15.90 mg/kg for Sea salt; 24.30 mg/kg – 25.40 mg/kg with mean value of 24.60 mg/kg for Dangote salt (blue sachet); 22.10 mg/kg – 23.10 mg/kg with mean value of 22.40 mg/kg for Dangote salt (red sachet); 23.30 mg/kg – 24.30 mg/kg with mean value of 23.60 mg/kg for Mr Chef salt; 23.30 mg/kg – 24.30 mg/kg with mean value of 23.60 mg/kg for Annapurna; 26.80 mg/kg – 27.50 mg/kg with mean value of 27.20mg/kg for Uncle Palm salt; 23.30 mg/kg – 29.60 mg/kg with mean content of 26.40 mg/kg for Dangote (bag); 25.40 mg/kg – 26.50 mg/kg with mean value of 26.50 mg/kg for Royal salt; 36.80 mg/kg – 37.20 mg/kg with mean iodine content of 37.0 mg/kg for Abakaliki refined salt, and 30.07 mg/kg – 31.20 mg/kg with mean value of 31.00 mg/kg for Ikom refined salt. The mean iodine content measured in the Sea salt brand (15.70 mg/kg) was significantly P < 0.01 lower compared to those measured in other table salt brands. Although the iodine content of Abakaliki and Ikom refined salt exceed the recommended value, it is clear that only Sea salt brand falls below the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended value (20 – 30 mg/kg), while the remaining table salt samples are just within the range. The results obtained have revealed that 70 % of the table salt brands were adequately iodized while 30 % of the table salt brands were not adequately iodized and provided baseline data that can be used for potential identification of human health risks associated with inadequate and/or excess iodine content in table salt brands consumed in households in Nigeria.","['Isotuk, Ifikairom G.', 'Ubong, Uwem U.', 'Ikpe, Edidiong E.', 'Ukpong, Emmanuel J.', 'Aniefiok Ite', 'Etesin, Usoro M.']",10.12691/ajhr-4-1-2,http://pubs.sciepub.com/ajhr/4/1/2/index.html,8,2017,Comparative Assessment of Iodine Content of Commercial Table Salt Brands Available in Nigerian Market,American Journal of Hypertension Research,,['Chemistry'],Human and Clinical Nutrition
"Malaysia is a rapidly developing economy experiencing a nutrition transition. It suffers from a double burden of over- and undernutrition, making it essential to understand diet quality in the population. In this scoping review, we have collated the existing literature on Malaysian diet quality, including factors that influence it, and the association between diet quality and health outcomes across the lifespan of Malaysians. Overall, diet quality was poor in all age groups studied. The Healthy Eating Index (HEI) and its iterations were predominantly used in urban and clinical settings to evaluate diet-chronic disease relationships. These indices were significantly associated with cardio-metabolic and disease risks in adults. The Diet Diversity Score (DDS) and Food Variety Score (FVS) were used to gauge diet quality in maternal and child nutrition studies and were associated with appropriate growth and caloric intake. Deficiencies were found in fruit, vegetable, legumes, and dairy intake. Meat, salt, and sugar intake were found to be excessive in many studies. The findings can inform policies to improve diet quality in this population. The review also identified knowledge gaps that require further investigation.","['Sangeetha Shyam', 'Shehzeen Alnoor Lalani', 'Su Ming Tham', 'Amutha Ramadas']",10.3390/nu13041380,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu13041380,4,2021,Diet Quality of Malaysians across Lifespan: A Scoping Review of Evidence in a Multi-Ethnic Population,Nutrients,"(['Food Science', 'Nutrition and Dietetics'],)",,Nutritional Epidemiology
"This study systematised and synthesised the results of observational studies that were aimed at supporting the association between dietary patterns and cardiometabolic risk (CMR) factors among adolescents. Relevant scientific articles were searched in PUBMED, EMBASE, SCIENCE DIRECT, LILACS, WEB OF SCIENCE and SCOPUS. Observational studies that included the measurement of any CMR factor in healthy adolescents and dietary patterns were included. The search strategy retained nineteen articles for qualitative analysis. Among retained articles, the effects of dietary pattern on the means of BMI (n 18), waist circumference (WC) (n 9), systolic blood pressure (n 7), diastolic blood pressure (n 6), blood glucose (n 5) and lipid profile (n 5) were examined. Systematised evidence showed that an unhealthy dietary pattern appears to be associated with poor mean values of CMR factors among adolescents. However, evidence of a protective effect of healthier dietary patterns in this group remains unclear. Considering the number of studies with available information, a meta-analysis of anthropometric measures showed that dietary patterns characterised by the highest intake of unhealthy foods resulted in a higher mean BMI (0·57 kg/m²; 95 % CI 0·51, 0·63) and WC (0·57 cm; 95 % CI 0·47, 0·67) compared with low intake of unhealthy foods. Controversially, patterns characterised by a low intake of healthy foods were associated with a lower mean BMI (−0·41 kg/m²; 95 % CI −0·46,−0·36) and WC (−0·43 cm; 95 % CI −0·52,−0·33). An unhealthy dietary pattern may influence markers of CMR among adolescents, but considering the small number and limitations of the studies included, further studies are warranted to strengthen the evidence of this relation.","['Ana Marlúcia Oliveira', 'Jacqueline C.

These were ‘Traditional’ (fish, eggs, local cakes), ‘Western’ (fast foods, meat, carbonated beverages) and ‘Mixed’ (ready-to-eat cereals, bread, vegetables). A fourth DP was generated in 2003, ‘Flatbread &amp; Beverages’ (flatbread, creamer, malted beverages), and 2014, ‘Noodles &amp; Meat’ (noodles, meat, eggs). These DP accounted for 25·6 and 26·6 % of DP variations in 2003 and 2014, respectively. For both years, Traditional DP was significantly associated with rural households, lower income, men and Malay ethnicity, while Western DP was associated with younger age and higher income. Mixed DP was positively associated with women and higher income. None of the DP showed positive association with overweight risk, except for reduced adjusted odds of overweight with adherence to Traditional DP in 2003.<jats:sec id=""S1368980019001861_as6"">Conclusions:Overweight could not be attributed to adherence to a single dietary pattern among Malaysian adults. This may be due to the constantly morphing dietary landscape in Malaysia, especially in urban areas, given the ease of availability and relative affordability of multi-ethnic and international foods. Timely surveys are recommended to monitor implications of these changes.","['Tahir Aris', 'Wan-Loy Chu', 'Stephen Ambu', 'Mohamad Hasnan', 'Balkish Mahadir', 'Rashidah Ambak', 'Geok-Lin Khor', 'Sangeetha Shyam']",10.1017/s1368980019001861,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s1368980019001861,8,2019,Association between dietary patterns and overweight risk among Malaysian adults: evidence from nationally representative surveys,Public Health Nutrition,"(['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Nutrition and Dietetics', 'Medicine (miscellaneous)'],)",,Nutritional Epidemiology

"The potential haematological effects associated with the oral administration of ethanolic root extract of Baphia nitida was investigated in rats. Phytochemical screening of Baphia nitida root extract revealed the presence of alkaloids, saponins, terpenes, tannins and flavonoids. The median lethal dose (LD50) studies revealed that the mice treated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with Baphia nitida root extract tolerated a considerable high dose of 5000 mg/kg of body weight without any manifestation. Twenty five Albino rats were randomly divided into five groups. The first 3 groups were the test groups. The fourth group served as negative control, the fifth group served as the positive control with 5 rats each. Groups I, II and III were gavaged with the extract of Baphia nitida in concentrations of 500 mg/kg, 1000 mg/kg and 1500 mg/kg respectively for 21 days. The negative control group received normal saline while the positive control received 10 mg/kg of folic acid (standard drug). The extract at the doses administered was found to increase in a dose- related fashion PCV and Hb (p < 0.05 for 500 mg/kg and p < 0.05 for 1000 mg/kg and 1500 mg/kg), RBC (P < 0.05 for 100 mg/Kg and 1500 mg/kg) and marginal increases that were not significant (P < 0.05 for 500 mg/kg); MCH and MCV (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 for 1000 mg/kg and 1500 mg/kg respectively) 500 mg/kg was not significant. MCHC recorded no significant change. WBC recorded marginal increases that were not significant (P < 0.05), similarly, the differential white blood cell recorded marginal increases that were not significant, except lymphocytes that recorded significant increase in group III (P < 0.05). The result of this study thus indicates haematopoietic potentials of the extract and could possibly remedy anaemia.

"The present study was carried out to investigate the phytochemical screening, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties of ethanol leave extract of Eryngium foetidum. Median lethal dose (LD50) of crude extract of Eryngium foetidum was examined inthraperitoneally. For evaluation of analgesic, acetic acid induced writhing response model was used. In anti-inflammation, xylene-induced ear oedema and egg albumin were used in Swiss albino mice. In both cases, leaves extract were administered and the obtained effects were compared with commercially available analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug acetyl salicylic acid. The results of phytochemical screening revealed the presence of saponins, flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins and anthraquinones, cardiac glycosides and terpenes. The LD50 value for Eryngium foetidum leaves extract was 1649.24 mg/kg. In analgesic bioassay, oral administration of the ethanol leaves extract reduced the writhing response in dose-dependent manner when compared with positive and the negative control i.e. 50%, 53% and 0% respectively. The ethanolic extract of Eryngium foetidum decreased the inflammation induced in both xylene and egg albumin. The degree of inhibition of leaves extract was not significant when compared to the effect of standard inflammatory drug, acetyl salicylic acid (53.26%). These results indicate that the extracts could possess analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. All these effects and the changes in the behavioural activities could be suggested as contributory effects to the use of Eryngium foetidum leaf in the management of inflammation and painful conditions.

In total, 112 Rhizoctonia solani and 19 binucleate Rhizoctonia (BNR) isolates were recovered from diseased potato plants, characterized for AG and pathogenicity. The AG identity of the isolates was confirmed using phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region of ribosomal DNA. R. solani isolates recovered belonged to AG 3-PT, AG 2-2IIIB, AG 4HG-I, AG 4HG-III, and AG 5, while BNR isolates belonged to AG A and AG R, with frequencies of 74, 6.1, 2.3, 2.3, 0.8, 12.2, and 2.3%, respectively. R. solani AG 3-PT was the most predominant AG and occurred in all the potato-growing regions sampled, whereas the other AG occurred in distinct locations. Different AG grouped into distinct clades, with high maximum parsimony and maximum-likelihood bootstrap support for both R. solani and BNR. An experiment under greenhouse conditions with representative isolates from different AG showed differences in aggressiveness between and within AG. Isolates of AG 2-2IIIB, AG 4HG-III, and AG R were the most aggressive in causing stem canker while AG 3-PT, AG 5, and AG R caused black scurf. This is the first comprehensive survey of R. solani and BNR on potato in South Africa using a molecular-based approach. This is the first report of R. solani AG 2-2IIIB and AG 4 HG-I causing stem and stolon canker and BNR AG A and AG R causing stem canker and black scurf on potato in South Africa.","['J.

"Suicide is among the 10 most common causes of death, as assessed by the World Health Organization. For every death by suicide, an estimated 138 people’s lives are meaningfully affected, and almost any other statistic around suicide deaths is equally alarming. The pervasiveness of social media—and the near-ubiquity of mobile devices used to access social media networks—offers new types of data for understanding the behavior of those who (attempt to) take their own lives and suggests new possibilities for preventive intervention. We demonstrate the feasibility of using social media data to detect those at risk for suicide. Specifically, we use natural language processing and machine learning (specifically deep learning) techniques to detect quantifiable signals around suicide attempts, and describe designs for an automated system for estimating suicide risk, usable by those without specialized mental health training (eg, a primary care doctor). We also discuss the ethical use of such technology and examine privacy implications. Currently, this technology is only used for intervention for individuals who have “opted in” for the analysis and intervention, but the technology enables scalable screening for suicide risk, potentially identifying many people who are at risk preventively and prior to any engagement with a health care system. This raises a significant cultural question about the trade-off between privacy and prevention—we have potentially life-saving technology that is currently reaching only a fraction of the possible people at risk because of respect for their privacy. Is the current trade-off between privacy and prevention the right one?","['Alex Fine', 'Patrick Crutchley', 'Ryan Leary', 'Glen Coppersmith']",10.1177/1178222618792860,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1178222618792860,1,2018,Natural Language Processing of Social Media as Screening for Suicide Risk,Biomedical Informatics Insights,"([],)",,Bioinformatics

"The number of people affected by mental illness is on the increase and with it the burden on health and social care use, as well as the loss of both productivity and quality-adjusted life-years. Natural language processing of electronic health records is increasingly used to study mental health conditions and risk behaviours on a large scale. However, narrative notes written by clinicians do not capture first-hand the patients’ own experiences, and only record cross-sectional, professional impressions at the point of care. Social media platforms have become a source of ‘in the moment’ daily exchange, with topics including well-being and mental health. In this study, we analysed posts from the social media platform Reddit and developed classifiers to recognise and classify posts related to mental illness according to 11 disorder themes. Using a neural network and deep learning approach, we could automatically recognise mental illness-related posts in our balenced dataset with an accuracy of 91.08% and select the correct theme with a weighted average accuracy of 71.37%. We believe that these results are a first step in developing methods to characterise large amounts of user-generated content that could support content curation and targeted interventions.","['Rina Dutta', 'Richard J.

"Despite progress in defining genetic risk for psychiatric disorders, their molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Addressing this, the PsychENCODE Consortium has generated a comprehensive online resource for the adult brain across 1866 individuals. The PsychENCODE resource contains ~79,000 brain-active enhancers, sets of Hi-C linkages, and topologically associating domains; single-cell expression profiles for many cell types; expression quantitative-trait loci (QTLs); and further QTLs associated with chromatin, splicing, and cell-type proportions. Integration shows that varying cell-type proportions largely account for the cross-population variation in expression (with &gt;88% reconstruction accuracy). It also allows building of a gene regulatory network, linking genome-wide association study variants to genes (e.g., 321 for schizophrenia). We embed this network into an interpretable deep-learning model, which improves disease prediction by ~6-fold versus polygenic risk scores and identifies key genes and pathways in psychiatric disorders.","['', 'Mark B.

"Background            COVID-19, caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2, is considered the most threatening respiratory infection in the world, with over 40 million people infected and over 0.934 million related deaths reported worldwide. It is speculated that epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 may differ across countries or continents. Genomic comparison of 48,635 SARS-CoV-2 genomes has shown that the average number of mutations per sample was 7.23, and most SARS-CoV-2 strains belong to one of 3 clades characterized by geographic and genomic specificity: Europe, Asia, and North America.                                Objective            The aim of this study was to compare the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated from Italy, Sweden, and Congo, that is, 3 different countries in the same meridian (longitude) but with different climate conditions, and from Brazil (as an outgroup country), to analyze similarities or differences in patterns of possible evolutionary pressure signatures in their genomes.                                Methods            We obtained data from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data repository by sampling all genomes available on that date. Using HyPhy, we achieved the recombination analysis by genetic algorithm recombination detection method, trimming, removal of the stop codons, and phylogenetic tree and mixed effects model of evolution analyses. We also performed secondary structure prediction analysis for both sequences (mutated and wild-type) and “disorder” and “transmembrane” analyses of the protein. We analyzed both protein structures with an ab initio approach to predict their ontologies and 3D structures.                                Results            Evolutionary analysis revealed that codon 9628 is under episodic selective pressure for all SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated from the 4 countries, suggesting it is a key site for virus evolution. Codon 9628 encodes the P0DTD3 (Y14_SARS2) uncharacterized protein 14. Further investigation showed that the codon mutation was responsible for helical modification in the secondary structure. The codon was positioned in the more ordered region of the gene (41-59) and near to the area acting as the transmembrane (54-67), suggesting its involvement in the attachment phase of the virus. The predicted protein structures of both wild-type and mutated P0DTD3 confirmed the importance of the codon to define the protein structure. Moreover, ontological analysis of the protein emphasized that the mutation enhances the binding probability.                                Conclusions            Our results suggest that RNA secondary structure may be affected and, consequently, the protein product changes T (threonine) to G (glycine) in position 50 of the protein. This position is located close to the predicted transmembrane region. Mutation analysis revealed that the change from G (glycine) to D (aspartic acid) may confer a new function to the protein—binding activity, which in turn may be responsible for attaching the virus to human eukaryotic cells. These findings can help design in vitro experiments and possibly facilitate a vaccine design and successful antiviral strategies.","['Shu-Lin Liu', 'Alexey V Rakov', 'Emilio Mastriani']",10.2196/25995,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/25995,1,2021,Isolating SARS-CoV-2 Strains From Countries in the Same Meridian: Genome Evolutionary Analysis,JMIR Bioinformatics and Biotechnology,"([],)",,Bioinformatics
"Background                Current approaches to identifying drug-drug interactions (DDIs), include safety studies during drug development and post-marketing surveillance after approval, offer important opportunities to identify potential safety issues, but are unable to provide complete set of all possible DDIs. Thus, the drug discovery researchers and healthcare professionals might not be fully aware of potentially dangerous DDIs. Predicting potential drug-drug interaction helps reduce unanticipated drug interactions and drug development costs and optimizes the drug design process. Methods for prediction of DDIs have the tendency to report high accuracy but still have little impact on translational research due to systematic biases induced by networked/paired data. In this work, we aimed to present realistic evaluation settings to predict DDIs using knowledge graph embeddings. We propose a simple disjoint cross-validation scheme to evaluate drug-drug interaction predictions for the scenarios where the drugs have no known DDIs.                              Results                We designed different evaluation settings to accurately assess the performance for predicting DDIs. The settings for disjoint cross-validation produced lower performance scores, as expected, but still were good at predicting the drug interactions. We have applied Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Random Forest on DrugBank knowledge graph with the 10-fold traditional cross validation using RDF2Vec, TransE and TransD. RDF2Vec with Skip-Gram generally surpasses other embedding methods. We also tested RDF2Vec on various drug knowledge graphs such as DrugBank, PharmGKB and KEGG to predict unknown drug-drug interactions. The performance was not enhanced significantly when an integrated knowledge graph including these three datasets was used.                              Conclusion                We showed that the knowledge embeddings are powerful predictors and comparable to current state-of-the-art methods for inferring new DDIs. We addressed the evaluation biases by introducing drug-wise and pairwise disjoint test classes. Although the performance scores for drug-wise and pairwise disjoint seem to be low, the results can be considered to be realistic in predicting the interactions for drugs with limited interaction information.","['Michel Dumontier', 'Oğuz DİKENELLİ', 'Ozgur Gumus', 'Erkan Yasar', 'Hüseyin  Uyar', 'Remzi Celebi']",10.1186/s12859-019-3284-5,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-019-3284-5,12,2019,Evaluation of knowledge graph embedding approaches for drug-drug interaction prediction in realistic settings,BMC Bioinformatics,"(['Applied Mathematics', 'Computer Science Applications', 'Molecular Biology', 'Biochemistry', 'Structural Biology'],)",,Bioinformatics

"Drug interactions, including drug–drug interactions (DDIs) and drug–food constituent interactions (DFIs), can trigger unexpected pharmacological effects, including adverse drug events (ADEs), with causal mechanisms often unknown. Several computational methods have been developed to better understand drug interactions, especially for DDIs. However, these methods do not provide sufficient details beyond the chance of DDI occurrence, or require detailed drug information often unavailable for DDI prediction. Here, we report development of a computational framework DeepDDI that uses names of drug–drug or drug–food constituent pairs and their structural information as inputs to accurately generate 86 important DDI types as outputs of human-readable sentences. DeepDDI uses deep neural network with its optimized prediction performance and predicts 86 DDI types with a mean accuracy of 92.4% using the DrugBank gold standard DDI dataset covering 192,284 DDIs contributed by 191,878 drug pairs. DeepDDI is used to suggest potential causal mechanisms for the reported ADEs of 9,284 drug pairs, and also predict alternative drug candidates for 62,707 drug pairs having negative health effects. Furthermore, DeepDDI is applied to 3,288,157 drug–food constituent pairs (2,159 approved drugs and 1,523 well-characterized food constituents) to predict DFIs. The effects of 256 food constituents on pharmacological effects of interacting drugs and bioactivities of 149 food constituents are predicted. These results suggest that DeepDDI can provide important information on drug prescription and even dietary suggestions while taking certain drugs and also guidelines during drug development.","['Sang Yup Lee', 'Hyun Uk Kim', 'Jae Yong Ryu']",10.1073/pnas.1803294115,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1803294115,4,2018,Deep learning improves prediction of drug–drug and drug–food interactions,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"(['Multidisciplinary'],)",,Bioinformatics
"An interaction between pharmacological agents can trigger unexpected adverse events. Capturing richer and more comprehensive information about drug–drug interactions (DDIs) is one of the key tasks in public health and drug development. Recently, several knowledge graph (KG) embedding approaches have received increasing attention in the DDI domain due to their capability of projecting drugs and interactions into a low-dimensional feature space for predicting links and classifying triplets. However, existing methods only apply a uniformly random mode to construct negative samples. As a consequence, these samples are often too simplistic to train an effective model. In this paper, we propose a new KG embedding framework by introducing adversarial autoencoders (AAEs) based on Wasserstein distances and Gumbel-Softmax relaxation for DDI tasks. In our framework, the autoencoder is employed to generate high-quality negative samples and the hidden vector of the autoencoder is regarded as a plausible drug candidate. Afterwards, the discriminator learns the embeddings of drugs and interactions based on both positive and negative triplets. Meanwhile, in order to solve vanishing gradient problems on the discrete representation—an inherent flaw in traditional generative models—we utilize the Gumbel-Softmax relaxation and the Wasserstein distance to train the embedding model steadily. We empirically evaluate our method on two tasks: link prediction and DDI classification. The experimental results show that our framework can attain significant improvements and noticeably outperform competitive baselines.

"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The viral outbreak started in late 2019 and rapidly became a serious health threat to the global population. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Several therapeutic options have been adopted to prevent the spread of the virus. Although vaccines have been developed, antivirals are still needed to combat the infection of this virus. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, and its genome encodes polyproteins that can be processed into structural and nonstructural proteins. Maturation of viral proteins requires cleavages by proteases. Therefore, the main protease (3 chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) or Mpro) encoded by the viral genome is an attractive drug target because it plays an important role in cleaving viral polyproteins into functional proteins. Inhibiting this enzyme is an efficient strategy to block viral replication. Structural studies provide valuable insight into the function of this protease and structural basis for rational inhibitor design. In this review, we describe structural studies on the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. The strategies applied in developing inhibitors of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 and currently available protein inhibitors are summarized. Due to the availability of high-resolution structures, structure-guided drug design will play an important role in developing antivirals. The availability of high-resolution structures, potent peptidic inhibitors, and diverse compound scaffolds indicate the feasibility of developing potent protease inhibitors as antivirals for COVID-19.","['CongBao Kang', 'Qingxin Li']",10.3390/microorganisms8081250,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms8081250,8,2020,Progress in Developing Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3C-Like Protease,Microorganisms,"(['Virology', 'Microbiology (medical)', 'Microbiology'],)",,Bioinformatics

"Leukemia is a fatal cancer and has two main types: Acute and chronic. Each type has two more subtypes: Lymphoid and myeloid. Hence, in total, there are four subtypes of leukemia. This study proposes a new approach for diagnosis of all subtypes of leukemia from microscopic blood cell images using convolutional neural networks (CNN), which requires a large training data set. Therefore, we also investigated the effects of data augmentation for an increasing number of training samples synthetically. We used two publicly available leukemia data sources: ALL-IDB and ASH Image Bank. Next, we applied seven different image transformation techniques as data augmentation. We designed a CNN architecture capable of recognizing all subtypes of leukemia. Besides, we also explored other well-known machine learning algorithms such as naive Bayes, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and decision tree. To evaluate our approach, we set up a set of experiments and used 5-fold cross-validation. The results we obtained from experiments showed that our CNN model performance has 88.25% and 81.74% accuracy, in leukemia versus healthy and multiclass classification of all subtypes, respectively. Finally, we also showed that the CNN model has a better performance than other wellknown machine learning algorithms.","['Alpkocak', 'Isik', 'Yigit', 'Ahmed']",10.3390/diagnostics9030104,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics9030104,8,2019,Identification of Leukemia Subtypes from Microscopic Images Using Convolutional Neural Network,Diagnostics,"(['Clinical Biochemistry'],)",,Bioinformatics
"Although automated Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) detection is essential, it is challenging due to the morphological correlation between malignant and normal cells. The traditional ALL classification strategy is arduous, time-consuming, often suffers inter-observer variations, and necessitates experienced pathologists. This article has automated the ALL detection task, employing deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We explore the weighted ensemble of deep CNNs to recommend a better ALL cell classifier. The weights are estimated from ensemble candidates' corresponding metrics, such as accuracy, F1-score, AUC, and kappa values. Various data augmentations and pre-processing are incorporated for achieving a better generalization of the network. We train and evaluate the proposed model utilizing the publicly available C-NMC-2019 ALL dataset. Our proposed weighted ensemble model has outputted a weighted F1-score of 88.6%, a balanced accuracy of 86.2%, and an AUC of 0.941 in the preliminary test set. The qualitative results displaying the gradient class activation maps confirm that the introduced model has a concentrated learned region. In contrast, the ensemble candidate models, such as Xception, VGG-16, DenseNet-121, MobileNet, and InceptionResNet-V2, separately produce coarse and scatter learned areas for most example cases. Since the proposed ensemble yields a better result for the aimed task, it can experiment in other domains of medical diagnostic applications.","['Mohammad Ali Moni', 'Salem A.

"The need to develop effective alternative for synthetic indicators is the demand of present-day chemistry. The acid-base indicator properties of Rose (Rosa setigera), Allamanda (Allamanda cathartica), and Hibiscus (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis) flowers were examined. Colour pigments were extracted from the flowers via cold and solvent extraction using soxhlet extractor. The pH value of the extracts with wavelengths of absorption was determined using ultraviolet spectrophotometer. From the results obtained, all the extracts exhibited sharp contrast between their colours in acid and base. Their pH was found to be 5.5 for cold extract of Rose and 5.6 for solvent extraction, 5.24 for cold extract of a Hibiscus and 6.52 for solvent extraction, 5.35 for cold extract of Allamanda, and 5.45 for solvent extraction. The maximum wavelengths of absorption obtained for all the extract fall within the visible region of electromagnetic spectrum. These values are almost similar to that obtained from synthetic indicators. It is on these bases that we concluded that natural indicators could be an excellent replacement for synthetic indicators since they are cheap, readily available, simple to extract, not toxic, user and environmentally friendly.","['Ameh A.

"Commonly used indicators for acid-base titrations are synthetic, and this work was focused to identify the eco-friendly natural indicators and to determine their pKa values. The analytical potential of the flower extracts is very promising as seen in its application in acid-base titrimetry. These selected flower extracts were found to perform well in titrating strong acid-strong base than in weak acid-strong base. We have obtained a sharp and clear colour change from red to brownish yellow for the Bougainvillea glabra extract, from red to yellow for the Bauhinia purpurea extract, and from red to brownish yellow for the Impatiens balsamina extract. All the three flower extracts gave clear colour change with acids and bases, and the colour change was maintained with different acids and bases. The sharp contrast between their colours in acid and base made the pigment suitable for use as acid-base indicators. As these flower extracts have very simple,cost-effective, environment friendly extraction procedure and excellent performance with sharp colour change in end points of the titrations, it would be possible to replace the standard indicators being used in conventional laboratories with natural flower indicators.","['M.

"Despite the importance of dyes within the industrial and research settings, the literature lacks information on the utilization of red mangrove forest resources and its applications. In this research study, red mangrove plant (Rhizophora racemosa) extracts were characterized and evaluated for its potential as an indicator. The extraction was done using the traditional method of extraction with water and ethanol as solvents. The extracts were characterized using ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy and Fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Extracts from the plant were applied in different types of acid-base titrations. Following extraction, the UV-vis analyses of the water extract of Rhizophora racemosa showed a λmax at 450 nm while that of theethanol extract revealed a λmax at 400 nm.  However, after a 72hour timepoint, the water extract of the Rhizophora racemosa showed a λmax at 559 nm while that of theethanol extract demonstrated a λmax at 572 nm. The results of the FT-IR analysis revealed the presence of the O‒H for alcohol and phenol, C=O for carboxylic acid, C‒H for methyl group, and N‒O for the nitro group. Moreover, the endpoints for all titration conducted using red mangrove plant (Rhizophora racemosa)extracts were similar to the endpoints obtained using standard synthetic acid-base indicators. This was confirmed by a change in colour of the extracts from yellow in an acidic solution to red wine in the alkaline solution. The results provided established the suitability of Rhizophora racemosa as a pH indicator.","['Ideriah Tubonimi', 'Ndokiari Boisa', 'Uebari Korfii']",10.22034/ajgc.2021.113192,http://www.ajgreenchem.com/article_113192.html,6,2021,Application of red mangrove plant (Rhizophora racemosa) extracts as pH indicator,Asian Journal of Green Chemistry,,['Chemistry'],Environmental Chemistry
"Dual functional fluorescence nanosensors have many potential applications in biology and medicine. Monitoring temperature with higher precision at localized small length scales or in a nanocavity is a necessity in various applications. As well as the detection of biologically interesting metal ions using low-cost and sensitive approach is of great importance in bioanalysis. In this paper, we describe the preparation of dual-function highly fluorescent B, N-co-doped carbon nanodots (CDs) that work as chemical and thermal sensors. The CDs emit blue fluorescence peaked at 450 nm and exhibit up to 70% photoluminescence quantum yield with showing excitation-independent fluorescence. We also show that water-soluble CDs display temperature-dependent fluorescence and can serve as highly sensitive and reliable nanothermometers with a thermo-sensitivity 1.8% °C−1, and wide range thermo-sensing between 0–90 °C with excellent recovery. Moreover, the fluorescence emission of CDs are selectively quenched after the addition of Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions while show no quenching with adding other common metal cations and anions. The fluorescence emission shows a good linear correlation with concentration of Fe2+ and Fe3+ (R2 = 0.9908 for Fe2+ and R2 = 0.9892 for Fe3+) with a detection limit of of 80.0 ± 0.5 nM for Fe2+ and 110.0 ± 0.5 nM for Fe3+. Considering the high quantum yield and selectivity, CDs are exploited to design a nanoprobe towards iron detection in a biological sample. The fluorimetric assay is used to detect Fe2+ in iron capsules and total iron in serum samples successfully.","['Khalid M.

"Cleavage of C–O bonds in lignin can afford the renewable aryl sources for fine chemicals. However, the high bond energies of these C–O bonds, especially the 4-O-5-type diaryl ether C–O bonds (~314 kJ/mol) make the cleavage very challenging. Here, we report visible-light photoredox-catalyzed C–O bond cleavage of diaryl ethers by an acidolysis with an aryl carboxylic acid and a following one-pot hydrolysis. Two molecules of phenols are obtained from one molecule of diaryl ether at room temperature. The aryl carboxylic acid used for the acidolysis can be recovered. The key to success of the acidolysis is merging visible-light photoredox catalysis using an acridinium photocatalyst and Lewis acid catalysis using Cu(TMHD)2. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the catalytic cycle occurs via a rare selective electrophilic attack of the generated aryl carboxylic radical on the electron-rich aryl ring of the diphenyl ether. This transformation is applied to a gram-scale reaction and the model of 4-O-5 lignin linkages.","['Yang Li', 'Wan-Fa Tian', 'Xiao-Ya He', 'Fang-Fang Tan']",10.1038/s41467-020-19944-x,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19944-x#Ack1,11,2020,Visible-light photoredox-catalyzed C–O bond cleavage of diaryl ethers by acridinium photocatalysts at room temperature,Nature Communications,"(['General Physics and Astronomy', 'General Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology', 'General Chemistry'],)",,Organic Chemistry

Used in a diagnostic role, these visualizations allow us to find model architectures that outperform Krizhevsky et al on the ImageNet classification benchmark. We also perform an ablation study to discover the performance contribution from different model layers.

"Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) and Transformer have achieved remarkable successes in image recognition. However, their performance in fine-grained image recognition is still difficult to meet the requirements of actual needs. This paper proposes a Sequence Random Network (SRN) to enhance the performance of DCNN. The output of DCNN is one-dimensional features. This onedimensional feature ly represents image information, but it does not express well the detailed information of image. To address this issue, we use the proposed SRN, which composed of BiLSTM and several Tanh-Dropout blocks (called BiLSTM-TDN), to further process DCNN one-dimensional features for highlighting the detail information of image. After the feature transform by BiLSTMTDN, the recognition performance has been greatly improved. We conducted the experiments on six fine-grained image datasets. Except for FGVC-Aircraft, the accuracy of the proposed methods on the other datasets exceeded 99%. Experimental results show that BiLSTM-TDN is far superior to the existing state-of-the-art methods. In addition to DCNN, BiLSTM-TDN can also be extended to other models, such as Transformer.

"Recently, neural networks purely based on attention were shown to address image understanding tasks such as image classification. However, these visual transformers are pre-trained with hundreds of millions of images using an expensive infrastructure, thereby limiting their adoption by the larger community. In this work, with an adequate training scheme, we produce a competitive convolution-free transformer by training on Imagenet only. We train it on a single computer in less than 3 days. Our reference vision transformer (86M parameters) achieves top-1 accuracy of 83.1% (single-crop evaluation) on ImageNet with no external data. We share our code and models to accelerate community advances on this line of research. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student strategy specific to transformers. It relies on a distillation token ensuring that the student learns from the teacher through attention. We show the interest of this tokenbased distillation, especially when using a convnet as a teacher. This leads us to report results competitive with convnets for both Imagenet (where we obtain up to 84.4% accuracy) and when transferring to other tasks.

"We present in this paper a new architecture, named Convolutional vision Transformer (CvT), that improves Vision Transformer (ViT) in performance and efficiency by introducing convolutions into ViT to yield the best of both designs. This is accomplished through two primary modifications: a hierarchy of Transformers containing a new convolutional token embedding, and a convolutional Transformer block leveraging a convolutional projection. These changes introduce desirable properties of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to the ViT architecture (i.e. shift, scale, and distortion invariance) while maintaining the merits of Transformers (i.e. dynamic attention, global context, and better generalization). We validate CvT by conducting extensive experiments, showing that this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance over other Vision Transformers and ResNets on ImageNet-1k, with fewer parameters and lower FLOPs. In addition, performance gains are maintained when pretrained on larger datasets (e.g. ImageNet-22k) and fine-tuned to downstream tasks. Pretrained on ImageNet-22k, our CvT-W24 obtains a top-1 accuracy of 87.7% on the ImageNet-1k val set.

"In today's heavily overparameterized models, the value of the training loss provides few guarantees on model generalization ability. Indeed, optimizing only the training loss value, as is commonly done, can easily lead to suboptimal model quality. Motivated by the connection between geometry of the loss landscape and generalization---including a generalization bound that we prove here---we introduce a novel, effective procedure for instead simultaneously minimizing loss value and loss sharpness. In particular, our procedure, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), seeks parameters that lie in neighborhoods having uniformly low loss; this formulation results in a min-max optimization problem on which gradient descent can be performed efficiently. We present empirical results showing that SAM improves model generalization across a variety of benchmark datasets (e.g., CIFAR-{10, 100}, ImageNet, finetuning tasks) and models, yielding novel state-of-the-art performance for several. Additionally, we find that SAM natively provides robustness to label noise on par with that provided by state-of-the-art procedures that specifically target learning with noisy labels.

"The Tsetlin Machine (TM) is an interpretable mechanism for pattern recognition that constructs conjunctive clauses from data. The clauses capture frequent patterns with high discriminating power, providing increasing expression power with each additional clause. However, the resulting accuracy gain comes at the cost of linear growth in computation time and memory usage. In this paper, we present the Weighted Tsetlin Machine (WTM), which reduces computation time and memory usage by weighting the clauses. Real-valued weighting allows one clause to replace multiple, and supports fine-tuning the impact of each clause. Our novel scheme simultaneously learns both the composition of the clauses and their weights. Furthermore, we increase training efficiency by replacing $k$ Bernoulli trials of success probability $p$ with a uniform sample of average size $p k$, the size drawn from a binomial distribution. In our empirical evaluation, the WTM achieved the same accuracy as the TM on MNIST, IMDb, and Connect-4, requiring only $1/4$, $1/3$, and $1/50$ of the clauses, respectively. With the same number of clauses, the WTM outperformed the TM, obtaining peak test accuracies of respectively $98.63\%$, $90.37\%$, and $87.91\%$.

We revisit principles from the extensive literature on convolutional neural networks to apply them to transformers, in particular activation maps with decreasing resolutions. We also introduce the attention bias, a new way to integrate positional information in vision transformers. As a result, we propose LeVIT: a hybrid neural network for fast inference image classification. We consider different measures of efficiency on different hardware platforms, so as to best reflect a wide range of application scenarios. Our extensive experiments empirically validate our technical choices and show they are suitable to most architectures.

"Transformers have been recently adapted for large scale image classification, achieving high scores shaking up the long supremacy of convolutional neural networks. However the optimization of image transformers has been little studied so far. In this work, we build and optimize deeper transformer networks for image classification. In particular, we investigate the interplay of architecture and optimization of such dedicated transformers. We make two transformers architecture changes that significantly improve the accuracy of deep transformers. This leads us to produce models whose performance does not saturate early with more depth, for instance we obtain 86.5% top-1 accuracy on Imagenet when training with no external data, we thus attain the current SOTA with less FLOPs and parameters.

"Motivated by the success of Transformers in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, there emerge some attempts (e.g., ViT and DeiT) to apply Transformers to the vision domain. However, pure Transformer architectures often require a large amount of training data or extra supervision to obtain comparable performance with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To overcome these limitations, we analyze the potential drawbacks when directly borrowing Transformer architectures from NLP. Then we propose a new Convolution-enhanced image Transformer (CeiT) which combines the advantages of CNNs in extracting lowlevel features, strengthening locality, and the advantages of Transformers in establishing long-range dependencies. Three modifications are made to the original Transformer: 1) instead of the straightforward tokenization from raw input images, we design an Image-to-Tokens (I2T) module that extracts patches from generated low-level features; 2) the feed-froward network in each encoder block is replaced with a Locally-enhanced Feed-Forward (LeFF) layer that promotes the correlation among neighboring tokens in the spatial dimension; 3) a Layer-wise Class token Attention (LCA) is attached at the top of the Transformer that utilizes the multi-level representations. Experimental results on ImageNet and seven downstream tasks show the effectiveness and generalization ability of CeiT compared with previous Transformers and stateof-the-art CNNs, without requiring a large amount of training data and extra CNN teachers. Besides, CeiT models also demonstrate better convergence with 3× fewer training iterations, which can reduce the training cost significantly1.

When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.

This distance proved to be quite effective, obtaining state-of-art error rates for classification tasks, but is also impracticable for large collections/documents due to its computational complexity. For circumventing this problem, variants of WMD have been proposed. Among them, Relaxed Word Mover's Distance (RWMD) is one of the most successful due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and also because of its fast implementations. Relying on assumptions that are supported by empirical properties of the distances between embeddings, we propose an approach to speed up both WMD and RWMD.

"In several domains, data objects can be decomposed into sets of simpler objects. It is then natural to represent each object as the set of its components or parts. Many conventional machine learning algorithms are unable to process this kind of representations, since sets may vary in cardinality and elements lack a meaningful ordering. In this paper, we present a new neural network architecture, called RepSet, that can handle examples that are represented as sets of vectors. The proposed model computes the correspondences between an input set and some hidden sets by solving a series of network flow problems. This representation is then fed to a standard neural network architecture to produce the output. The architecture allows end-to-end gradient-based learning. We demonstrate RepSet on classification tasks, including text categorization, and graph classification, and we show that the proposed neural network achieves performance better or comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms.

"Since the seminal work of Mikolov et al., word embeddings have become the preferred word representations for many natural language processing tasks. Document similarity measures extracted from word embeddings, such as the soft cosine measure (SCM) and the Word Mover's Distance (WMD), were reported to achieve state-of-the-art performance on semantic text similarity and text classification. Despite the strong performance of the WMD on text classification and semantic text similarity, its super-cubic average time complexity is impractical. The SCM has quadratic worst-case time complexity, but its performance on text classification has never been compared with the WMD. Recently, two word embedding regularization techniques were shown to reduce storage and memory costs, and to improve training speed, document processing speed, and task performance on word analogy, word similarity, and semantic text similarity. However, the effect of these techniques on text classification has not yet been studied. In our work, we investigate the individual and joint effect of the two word embedding regularization techniques on the document processing speed and the task performance of the SCM and the WMD on text classification. For evaluation, we use the $k$NN classifier and six standard datasets: BBCSPORT, TWITTER, OHSUMED, REUTERS-21578, AMAZON, and 20NEWS. We show 39% average $k$NN test error reduction with regularized word embeddings compared to non-regularized word embeddings.

The ADM is trained in a self-supervised fashion to predict the actions taken by the agent. The learned contingency information is used as a part of the state representation for exploration purposes. We demonstrate that combining actor-critic algorithm with count-based exploration using our representation achieves impressive results on a set of notoriously challenging Atari games due to sparse rewards.

Our approach is based on the successor representation (SR), which was originally introduced as a representation defining state generalization by the similarity of successor states. Here we show that the norm of the SR, while it is being learned, can be used as a reward bonus to incentivize exploration. In order to better understand this transient behavior of the norm of the SR we introduce the substochastic successor representation (SSR) and we show that it implicitly counts the number of times each state (or feature) has been observed. We use this result to introduce an algorithm that performs as well as some theoretically sample-efficient approaches.

This has prevented the combination of scalable RL algorithms with efficient exploration strategies that drive the agent to reduce its uncertainty. We present a new method for computing a generalised state visit-count, which allows the agent to estimate the uncertainty associated with any state. Our \phi-pseudocount achieves generalisation by exploiting same feature representation of the state space that is used for value function approximation. States that have less frequently observed features are deemed more uncertain.

We consider two questions left open by their work: First, how important is the quality of the density model for exploration? Second, what role does the Monte Carlo update play in exploration? We answer the first question by demonstrating the use of PixelCNN, an advanced neural density model for images, to supply a pseudo-count. In particular, we examine the intrinsic difficulties in adapting Bellemare et al.'s approach when assumptions about the model are violated. The result is a more practical and general algorithm requiring no special apparatus. We combine PixelCNN pseudo-counts with different agent architectures to dramatically improve the state of the art on several hard Atari games. One surprising finding is that the mixed Monte Carlo update is a powerful facilitator of exploration in the sparsest of settings, including Montezuma's Revenge.

"Count-based exploration algorithms are known to perform near-optimally when used in conjunction with tabular reinforcement learning (RL) methods for solving small discrete Markov decision processes (MDPs). It is generally thought that count-based methods cannot be applied in high-dimensional state spaces, since most states will only occur once.Recent deep RL exploration strategies are able to deal with high-dimensional continuous state spaces through complex heuristics, often relying on optimism in the face of uncertainty or intrinsic motivation. In this work, we describe a surprising finding: a simple generalization of the classic count-based approach can reach near state-of-the-art performance on various high-dimensional and/or continuous deep RL benchmarks.","['Pieter Abbeel', 'Filip De Turck', 'John Schulman', 'Yan Duan', 'Xi Chen', 'Adam Stooke', 'Davis Foote', 'Rein Houthooft', 'Haoran Tang']",,http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04717v3.pdf,11,2016,#Exploration: A Study of Count-Based Exploration for Deep Reinforcement Learning,ArXiv,,,Computer Sciences

"A grand challenge in reinforcement learning is intelligent exploration, especially when rewards are sparse or deceptive. Two Atari games serve as benchmarks for such hard-exploration domains: Montezuma's Revenge and Pitfall. On both games, current RL algorithms perform poorly, even those with intrinsic motivation, which is the dominant method to improve performance on hard-exploration domains. To address this shortfall, we introduce a new algorithm called Go-Explore. It exploits the following principles: (1) remember previously visited states, (2) first return to a promising state (without exploration), then explore from it, and (3) solve simulated environments through any available means (including by introducing determinism), then robustify via imitation learning. The combined effect of these principles is a dramatic performance improvement on hard-exploration problems. On Montezuma's Revenge, Go-Explore scores a mean of over 43k points, almost 4 times the previous state of the art. Go-Explore can also harness human-provided domain knowledge and, when augmented with it, scores a mean of over 650k points on Montezuma's Revenge. Its max performance of nearly 18 million surpasses the human world record, meeting even the strictest definition of ""superhuman"" performance. On Pitfall, Go-Explore with domain knowledge is the first algorithm to score above zero. Its mean score of almost 60k points exceeds expert human performance. Because Go-Explore produces high-performing demonstrations automatically and cheaply, it also outperforms imitation learning work where humans provide solution demonstrations. Go-Explore opens up many new research directions into improving it and weaving its insights into current RL algorithms. It may also enable progress on previously unsolvable hard-exploration problems in many domains, especially those that harness a simulator during training (e.g. robotics).

"Distributional Reinforcement Learning (RL) differs from traditional RL in that, rather than the expectation of total returns, it estimates distributions and has achieved state-of-the-art performance on Atari Games. The key challenge in practical distributional RL algorithms lies in how to parameterize estimated distributions so as to better approximate the true continuous distribution. Existing distributional RL algorithms parameterize either the probability side or the return value side of the distribution function, leaving the other side uniformly fixed as in C51, QR-DQN or randomly sampled as in IQN. In this paper, we propose fully parameterized quantile function that parameterizes both the quantile fraction axis (i.e., the x-axis) and the value axis (i.e., y-axis) for distributional RL. Our algorithm contains a fraction proposal network that generates a discrete set of quantile fractions and a quantile value network that gives corresponding quantile values. The two networks are jointly trained to find the best approximation of the true distribution. Experiments on 55 Atari Games show that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing distributional RL algorithms and creates a new record for the Atari Learning Environment for non-distributed agents.

"In this work we present a new agent architecture, called Reactor, which combines multiple algorithmic and architectural contributions to produce an agent with higher sample-efficiency than Prioritized Dueling DQN (Wang et al., 2016) and Categorical DQN (Bellemare et al., 2017), while giving better run-time performance than A3C (Mnih et al., 2016). Our first contribution is a new policy evaluation algorithm called Distributional Retrace, which brings multi-step off-policy updates to the distributional reinforcement learning setting. The same approach can be used to convert several classes of multi-step policy evaluation algorithms designed for expected value evaluation into distributional ones. Next, we introduce the \b{eta}-leave-one-out policy gradient algorithm which improves the trade-off between variance and bias by using action values as a baseline. Our final algorithmic contribution is a new prioritized replay algorithm for sequences, which exploits the temporal locality of neighboring observations for more efficient replay prioritization. Using the Atari 2600 benchmarks, we show that each of these innovations contribute to both the sample efficiency and final agent performance. Finally, we demonstrate that Reactor reaches state-of-the-art performance after 200 million frames and less than a day of training.

"Recent advances in off-policy deep reinforcement learning (RL) have led to impressive success in complex tasks from visual observations. Experience replay improves sample-efficiency by reusing experiences from the past, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) process high-dimensional inputs effectively. However, such techniques demand high memory and computational bandwidth. In this paper, we present Stored Embeddings for Efficient Reinforcement Learning (SEER), a simple modification of existing off-policy RL methods, to address these computational and memory requirements. To reduce the computational overhead of gradient updates in CNNs, we freeze the lower layers of CNN encoders early in training due to early convergence of their parameters. Additionally, we reduce memory requirements by storing the low-dimensional latent vectors for experience replay instead of high-dimensional images, enabling an adaptive increase in the replay buffer capacity, a useful technique in constrained-memory settings. In our experiments, we show that SEER does not degrade the performance of RL agents while significantly saving computation and memory across a diverse set of DeepMind Control environments and Atari games. Finally, we show that SEER is useful for computation-efficient transfer learning in RL because lower layers of CNNs extract generalizable features, which can be used for different tasks and domains.

Experiments on MuJoCo and Atari show that ES is a viable solution strategy that scales extremely well with the number of CPUs available: By using a novel communication strategy based on common random numbers, our ES implementation only needs to communicate scalars, making it possible to scale to over a thousand parallel workers. This allows us to solve 3D humanoid walking in 10 minutes and obtain competitive results on most Atari games after one hour of training. In addition, we highlight several advantages of ES as a black box optimization technique: it is invariant to action frequency and delayed rewards, tolerant of extremely long horizons, and does not need temporal discounting or value function approximation.

We consider the setting of semi-supervised cross-lingual understanding, where labeled data is available in a source language (English), but only unlabeled data is available in the target language. We combine state-of-the-art cross-lingual methods with recently proposed methods for weakly supervised learning such as unsupervised pre-training and unsupervised data augmentation to simultaneously close both the language gap and the domain gap in XLU.

"Neural architecture search (NAS) has emerged as a promising avenue for automatically designing task-specific neural networks. Existing NAS approaches require one complete search for each deployment specification of hardware or objective. This is a computationally impractical endeavor given the potentially large number of application scenarios. In this paper, we propose <italic>Neural Architecture Transfer</italic> (NAT) to overcome this limitation. NAT is designed to efficiently generate task-specific custom models that are competitive under multiple conflicting objectives. To realize this goal we learn task-specific supernets from which specialized subnets can be sampled without any additional training. The key to our approach is an integrated online transfer learning and many-objective evolutionary search procedure. A pre-trained supernet is iteratively adapted while simultaneously searching for task-specific subnets. We demonstrate the efficacy of NAT on 11 benchmark image classification tasks ranging from large-scale multi-class to small-scale fine-grained datasets. In all cases, including ImageNet, NATNets improve upon the state-of-the-art under mobile settings (<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\leq$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=""boddeti-ieq1-3052758.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula> 600M Multiply-Adds). Surprisingly, small-scale fine-grained datasets benefit the most from NAT. At the same time, the architecture search and transfer is orders of magnitude more efficient than existing NAS methods. Overall, experimental evaluation indicates that, across diverse image classification tasks and computational objectives, NAT is an appreciably more effective alternative to conventional transfer learning of fine-tuning weights of an existing network architecture learned on standard datasets.

"The reinforcement learning (RL) community has made great strides in designing algorithms capable of exceeding human performance on specific tasks. These algorithms are mostly trained one task at the time, each new task requiring to train a brand new agent instance. This means the learning algorithm is general, but each solution is not; each agent can only solve the one task it was trained on. In this work, we study the problem of learning to master not one but multiple sequentialdecision tasks at once. A general issue in multi-task learning is that a balance must be found between the needs of multiple tasks competing for the limited resources of a single learning system. Many learning algorithms can get distracted by certain tasks in the set of tasks to solve. Such tasks appear more salient to the learning process, for instance because of the density or magnitude of the in-task rewards. This causes the algorithm to focus on those salient tasks at the expense of generality. We propose to automatically adapt the contribution of each task to the agent’s updates, so that all tasks have a similar impact on the learning dynamics. This resulted in state of the art performance on learning to play all games in a set of 57 diverse Atari games. Excitingly, our method learned a single trained policy - with a single set of weights - that exceeds median human performance. To our knowledge, this was the first time a single agent surpassed human-level performance on this multi-task domain. The same approach also demonstrated state of the art performance on a set of 30 tasks in the 3D reinforcement learning platform DeepMind Lab.","['Hado van Hasselt', 'Simon Schmitt', 'Wojciech Czarnecki', 'Lasse Espeholt', 'Hubert Soyer', 'Matteo Hessel']",10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33013796,http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04474v1.pdf,9,2018,Multi-task Deep Reinforcement Learning with PopArt,['Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence'],"([],)",,Computer Sciences
"We present Decentralized Distributed Proximal Policy Optimization (DD-PPO), a method for distributed reinforcement learning in resource-intensive simulated environments. DD-PPO is distributed (uses multiple machines), decentralized (lacks a centralized server), and synchronous (no computation is ever ""stale""), making it conceptually simple and easy to implement. In our experiments on training virtual robots to navigate in Habitat-Sim, DD-PPO exhibits near-linear scaling -- achieving a speedup of 107x on 128 GPUs over a serial implementation. We leverage this scaling to train an agent for 2.5 Billion steps of experience (the equivalent of 80 years of human experience) -- over 6 months of GPU-time training in under 3 days of wall-clock time with 64 GPUs. This massive-scale training not only sets the state of art on Habitat Autonomous Navigation Challenge 2019, but essentially ""solves"" the task -- near-perfect autonomous navigation in an unseen environment without access to a map, directly from an RGB-D camera and a GPS+Compass sensor. Fortuitously, error vs computation exhibits a power-law-like distribution; thus, 90% of peak performance is obtained relatively early (at 100 million steps) and relatively cheaply (under 1 day with 8 GPUs). Finally, we show that the scene understanding and navigation policies learned can be transferred to other navigation tasks -- the analog of ""ImageNet pre-training + task-specific fine-tuning"" for embodied AI. Our model outperforms ImageNet pre-trained CNNs on these transfer tasks and can serve as a universal resource (all models and code are publicly available).

"This work studies the problem of object goal navigation which involves navigating to an instance of the given object category in unseen environments. End-to-end learning-based navigation methods struggle at this task as they are ineffective at exploration and long-term planning. We propose a modular system called, `Goal-Oriented Semantic Exploration' which builds an episodic semantic map and uses it to explore the environment efficiently based on the goal object category. Empirical results in visually realistic simulation environments show that the proposed model outperforms a wide range of baselines including end-to-end learning-based methods as well as modular map-based methods and led to the winning entry of the CVPR-2020 Habitat ObjectNav Challenge. Ablation analysis indicates that the proposed model learns semantic priors of the relative arrangement of objects in a scene, and uses them to explore efficiently. Domain-agnostic module design allow us to transfer our model to a mobile robot platform and achieve similar performance for object goal navigation in the real-world.

"Recent work has presented embodied agents that can navigate to point-goal targets in novel indoor environments with near-perfect accuracy. However, these agents are equipped with idealized sensors for localization and take deterministic actions. This setting is practically sterile by comparison to the dirty reality of noisy sensors and actuations in the real world -- wheels can slip, motion sensors have error, actuations can rebound. In this work, we take a step towards this noisy reality, developing point-goal navigation agents that rely on visual estimates of egomotion under noisy action dynamics. We find these agents outperform naive adaptions of current point-goal agents to this setting as well as those incorporating classic localization baselines. Further, our model conceptually divides learning agent dynamics or odometry (where am I?) from task-specific navigation policy (where do I want to go?). This enables a seamless adaption to changing dynamics (a different robot or floor type) by simply re-calibrating the visual odometry model -- circumventing the expense of re-training of the navigation policy. Our agent was the runner-up in the PointNav track of CVPR 2020 Habitat Challenge.

"Biological systems understand the world by simultaneously processing high-dimensional inputs from modalities as diverse as vision, audition, touch, proprioception, etc. The perception models used in deep learning on the other hand are designed for individual modalities, often relying on domain-specific assumptions such as the local grid structures exploited by virtually all existing vision models. These priors introduce helpful inductive biases, but also lock models to individual modalities. In this paper we introduce the Perceiver – a model that builds upon Transformers and hence makes few architectural assumptions about the relationship between its inputs, but that also scales to hundreds of thousands of inputs, like ConvNets. The model leverages an asymmetric attention mechanism to iteratively distill inputs into a tight latent bottleneck, allowing it to scale to handle very large inputs. We show that this architecture performs competitively or beyond strong, specialized models on classification tasks across various modalities: images, point clouds, audio, video and video+audio. The Perceiver obtains performance comparable to ResNet-50 on ImageNet without convolutions and by directly attending to 50,000 pixels. It also surpasses state-of-the-art results for all modalities in AudioSet.

"While normalizing flows have led to significant advances in modeling high-dimensional continuous distributions, their applicability to discrete distributions remains unknown. In this paper, we show that flows can in fact be extended to discrete events---and under a simple change-of-variables formula not requiring log-determinant-Jacobian computations. Discrete flows have numerous applications. We consider two flow architectures: discrete autoregressive flows that enable bidirectionality, allowing, for example, tokens in text to depend on both left-to-right and right-to-left contexts in an exact language model; and discrete bipartite flows that enable efficient non-autoregressive generation as in RealNVP. Empirically, we find that discrete autoregressive flows outperform autoregressive baselines on synthetic discrete distributions, an addition task, and Potts models; and bipartite flows can obtain competitive performance with autoregressive baselines on character-level language modeling for Penn Tree Bank and text8.

"Recurrent Neural Networks have long been the dominating choice for sequence modeling. However, it severely suffers from two issues: impotent in capturing very long-term dependencies and unable to parallelize the sequential computation procedure. Therefore, many non-recurrent sequence models that are built on convolution and attention operations have been proposed recently. Notably, models with multi-head attention such as Transformer have demonstrated extreme effectiveness in capturing long-term dependencies in a variety of sequence modeling tasks. Despite their success, however, these models lack necessary components to model local structures in sequences and heavily rely on position embeddings that have limited effects and require a considerable amount of design efforts. In this paper, we propose the R-Transformer which enjoys the advantages of both RNNs and the multi-head attention mechanism while avoids their respective drawbacks. The proposed model can effectively capture both local structures and global long-term dependencies in sequences without any use of position embeddings. We evaluate R-Transformer through extensive experiments with data from a wide range of domains and the empirical results show that R-Transformer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in most of the tasks.

"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are important class of architectures among neural networks useful for language modeling and sequential prediction. However, optimizing RNNs is known to be harder compared to feed-forward neural networks. A number of techniques have been proposed in literature to address this problem. In this paper we propose a simple technique called fraternal dropout that takes advantage of dropout to achieve this goal. Specifically, we propose to train two identical copies of an RNN (that share parameters) with different dropout masks while minimizing the difference between their (pre-softmax) predictions. In this way our regularization encourages the representations of RNNs to be invariant to dropout mask, thus being robust. We show that our regularization term is upper bounded by the expectation-linear dropout objective which has been shown to address the gap due to the difference between the train and inference phases of dropout. We evaluate our model and achieve state-of-the-art results in sequence modeling tasks on two benchmark datasets - Penn Treebank and Wikitext-2. We also show that our approach leads to performance improvement by a significant margin in image captioning (Microsoft COCO) and semi-supervised (CIFAR-10) tasks.

To get good results at this depth, we show that it is important to add auxiliary losses, both at intermediate network layers and intermediate sequence positions.","['Llion Jones', 'Mandy Guo', 'Noah Constant', 'Dokook Choe', 'Rami Al-Rfou']",10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33013159,http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04444v2.pdf,8,2018,Character-Level Language Modeling with Deeper Self-Attention,['Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence'],"([],)",,Computer Sciences
"Transformer networks have lead to important progress in language modeling and machine translation. These models include two consecutive modules, a feed-forward layer and a self-attention layer. The latter allows the network to capture long term dependencies and are often regarded as the key ingredient in the success of Transformers. Building upon this intuition, we propose a new model that solely consists of attention layers. More precisely, we augment the self-attention layers with persistent memory vectors that play a similar role as the feed-forward layer. Thanks to these vectors, we can remove the feed-forward layer without degrading the performance of a transformer. Our evaluation shows the benefits brought by our model on standard character and word level language modeling benchmarks.

Transformers use stacked layers of self-attention that allow them to capture long range dependencies in sequential data. Dynamic evaluation fits models to the recent sequence history, allowing them to assign higher probabilities to re-occurring sequential patterns. By applying dynamic evaluation to Transformer-XL models, we improve the state of the art on enwik8 from 0.99 to 0.94 bits/char, text8 from 1.08 to 1.04 bits/char, and WikiText-103 from 18.3 to 16.4 perplexity points.

"Transformers are powerful sequence models, but require time and memory that grows quadratically with the sequence length. In this paper we introduce sparse factorizations of the attention matrix which reduce this to $O(n \sqrt{n})$. We also introduce a) a variation on architecture and initialization to train deeper networks, b) the recomputation of attention matrices to save memory, and c) fast attention kernels for training. We call networks with these changes Sparse Transformers, and show they can model sequences tens of thousands of timesteps long using hundreds of layers. We use the same architecture to model images, audio, and text from raw bytes, setting a new state of the art for density modeling of Enwik8, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet-64. We generate unconditional samples that demonstrate global coherence and great diversity, and show it is possible in principle to use self-attention to model sequences of length one million or more.

"Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.

"Without real bilingual corpus available, unsupervised Neural Machine Translation (NMT) typically requires pseudo parallel data generated with the back-translation method for the model training. However, due to weak supervision, the pseudo data inevitably contain noises and errors that will be accumulated and reinforced in the subsequent training process, leading to bad translation performance. To address this issue, we introduce phrase based Statistic Machine Translation (SMT) models which are robust to noisy data, as posterior regularizations to guide the training of unsupervised NMT models in the iterative back-translation process. Our method starts from SMT models built with pre-trained language models and word-level translation tables inferred from cross-lingual embeddings. Then SMT and NMT models are optimized jointly and boost each other incrementally in a unified EM framework. In this way, (1) the negative effect caused by errors in the iterative back-translation process can be alleviated timely by SMT filtering noises from its phrase tables; meanwhile, (2) NMT can compensate for the deficiency of fluency inherent in SMT. Experiments conducted on en-fr and en-de translation tasks show that our method outperforms the strong baseline and achieves new state-of-the-art unsupervised machine translation performance.","['Shuai Ma', 'Ming Zhou', 'Shujie Liu', 'Zhirui Zhang', 'Shuo Ren']",10.1609/aaai.v33i01.3301241,http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04112v1.pdf,1,2019,Unsupervised Neural Machine Translation with SMT as Posterior Regularization,['Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence'],"([],)",,Computer Sciences

"Most existing methods determine relation types only after all the entities have been recognized, thus the interaction between relation types and entity mentions is not fully modeled. This paper presents a novel paradigm to deal with relation extraction by regarding the related entities as the arguments of a relation. We apply a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework in this paradigm to enhance the interaction between entity mentions and relation types. The whole extraction process is decomposed into a hierarchy of two-level RL policies for relation detection and entity extraction respectively, so that it is more feasible and natural to deal with overlapping relations. Our model was evaluated on public datasets collected via distant supervision, and results show that it gains better performance than existing methods and is more powerful for extracting overlapping relations1.","['Minlie Huang', 'Jiexi Liu', 'Tianyang Zhang', 'Ryuichi Takanobu']",10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33017072,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03925v1.pdf,11,2018,A Hierarchical Framework for Relation Extraction with Reinforcement Learning,['Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence'],"([],)",,Computer Sciences

Extracting such relation tuples from a sentence is a difficult task and sharing of entities or overlapping entities among the tuples makes it more challenging. Most prior work adopted a pipeline approach where entities were identified first followed by finding the relations among them, thus missing the interaction among the relation tuples in a sentence. In this paper, we propose two approaches to use encoder-decoder architecture for jointly extracting entities and relations. In the first approach, we propose a representation scheme for relation tuples which enables the decoder to generate one word at a time like machine translation models and still finds all the tuples present in a sentence with full entity names of different length and with overlapping entities. Next, we propose a pointer network-based decoding approach where an entire tuple is generated at every time step. Experiments on the publicly available New York Times corpus show that our proposed approaches outperform previous work and achieve significantly higher F1 scores.","['Hwee Tou Ng', 'Tapas Nayak']",10.1609/aaai.v34i05.6374,https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09886v1.pdf,11,2019,Effective Modeling of Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Joint Entity and Relation Extraction,['Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence'],"([],)",,Computer Sciences

"RationaleSeveral studies have estimated basic production number of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). However, the time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP during the outbreak remain unclear.ObjectivesWe aimed to estimate the basic and time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP across China, and compared them with SARS.MethodsData on NCP cases by February 7, 2020 were collected from epidemiological investigations or official websites. Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases in Guangdong Province, Beijing and Hong Kong during 2002-2003 were also obtained. We estimated the doubling time, basic reproduction number (R0) and time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of NCP and SARS.Measurements and main resultsAs of February 7, 2020, 34,598 NCP cases were identified in China, and daily confirmed cases decreased after February 4. The doubling time of NCP nationwide was 2.4 days which was shorter than that of SARS in Guangdong (14.3 days), Hong Kong (5.7 days) and Beijing (12.4 days). TheR0of NCP cases nationwide and in Wuhan were 4.5 and 4.4 respectively, which were higher thanR0of SARS in Guangdong (R0=2.3), Hongkong (R0=2.3), and Beijing (R0=2.6). TheRtfor NCP continuously decreased especially after January 16 nationwide and in Wuhan. TheR0for secondary NCP cases in Guangdong was 0.6, and theRtvalues were less than 1 during the epidemic.ConclusionsNCP may have a higher transmissibility than SARS, and the efforts of containing the outbreak are effective. However, the efforts are needed to persist in for reducing time-varying reproduction number below one.At a Glance CommentaryScientific Knowledge on the SubjectSince December 29, 2019, pneumonia infection with 2019-nCoV, now named as Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP), occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other areas. As a novel virus, the time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP remain unclear, and it is also important to compare it with SARS.What This Study Adds to the FieldWe compared the transmission dynamics of NCP with SARS, and found that NCP has a higher transmissibility than SARS. Time-varying production number indicates that rigorous control measures taken by governments are effective across China, and persistent efforts are needed to be taken for reducing instantaneous reproduction number below one.","['Wenjun Ma', 'Jianfeng He', 'Tie Song', 'Wenjia Liang', 'Limei Sun', 'Yan Li', 'Lingchuan Guo', 'Shaowei Chen', 'Donghua Wan', 'Dexin Gong', 'Jiansen Li', 'Zhihua Zhu', 'Siqing Zeng', 'Xiaohua Tan', 'Weilin Zeng', 'Aiping Deng', 'Qiong Huang', 'Haojie Zhong', 'Lifeng Lin', 'Zuhua Rong', 'Min Kang', 'Guanhao He', 'Jianpeng Xiao', 'Jianxiong Hu', 'Tao Liu']",10.1101/2020.01.25.919787,http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.25.919787,1,2020,Time-varying transmission dynamics of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia in China,[],"([],)",,Computer Sciences
"BackgroundsAn ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia hit a major city of China, Wuhan, December 2019 and subsequently reached other provinces/regions of China and countries. We present estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak.MethodsAccounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the estimated intrinsic growth rate (γ), we estimated R0 by using the serial intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true unknown SI.FindingsThe early outbreak data largely follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R0 ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96-2.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89-4.39) associated with 8-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate. We demonstrated that changes in reporting rate substantially affect estimates of R0.ConclusionThe mean estimate of R0 for the 2019-nCoV ranges from 2.24 to 3.58, and significantly larger than 1. Our findings indicate the potential of 2019-nCoV to cause outbreaks.","['Maggie H Wang', 'Daihai He', 'Lin Yang', 'Daozhou Gao', 'Yijun Lou', 'Weiming Wang', 'Guangpu Yang', 'Salihu S Musa', 'Jinjun Ran', 'Qianyin Lin', 'Shi Zhao']",10.1101/2020.01.23.916395,http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.23.916395,1,2020,"Preliminary estimation of the basic reproduction number of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China, from 2019 to 2020: A data-driven analysis in the early phase of the outbreak",[],"([],)",,Computer Sciences

"Tabular data is an abundant source of information on the Web, but remains mostly isolated from the latter's interconnections since tables lack links and computer-accessible descriptions of their structure. In other words, the schemas of these tables -- attribute names, values, data types, etc. -- are not explicitly stored as table metadata. Consequently, the structure that these tables contain is not accessible to the crawlers that power search engines and thus not accessible to user search queries. We address this lack of structure with a new method for leveraging the principles of table construction in order to extract table schemas. Discovering the schema by which a table is constructed is achieved by harnessing the similarities and differences of nearby table rows through the use of a novel set of features and a feature processing scheme. The schemas of these data tables are determined using a classification technique based on conditional random fields in combination with a novel feature encoding method called logarithmic binning, which is specifically designed for the data table extraction task. Our method provides considerable improvement over the well-known WebTables schema extraction method. In contrast with previous work that focuses on extracting individual relations, our method excels at correctly interpreting full tables, thereby being capable of handling general tables such as those found in spreadsheets, instead of being restricted to HTML tables as is the case with the WebTables method. We also extract additional schema characteristics, such as row groupings, which are important for supporting information retrieval tasks on tabular data.","['Hanan Samet', 'Marco D.

"The aims of XML data conversion to ontologies are the indexing, integration and enrichment of existing ontologies with knowledge acquired from these sources. The contribution of this paper consists in providing a classification of the approaches used for the conversion of XML documents into OWL ontologies. This classification underlines the usage profile of each conversion method, providing a clear description of the advantages and drawbacks belonging to each method. Hence, this paper focuses on two main processes, which are ontology enrichment and ontology population using XML data. Ontology enrichment is related to the schema of the ontology (TBox), and ontology population is related to an individual (Abox). In addition, the ontologies described in these methods are based on formal languages of the Semantic Web such as OWL (Ontology Web Language) or RDF (Resource Description Framework). These languages are formal because the semantics are formally defined and take advantage of the Description Logics. In contrast, XML data sources are without formal semantics. The XML language is used to store, export and share data between processes able to process the specific data structure. However, even if the semantics is not explicitly expressed, data structure contains the universe of discourse by using a qualified vocabulary regarding a consensual agreement. In order to formalize this semantics, the OWL language provides rich logical constraints. Therefore, these logical constraints are evolved in the transformation of XML documents into OWL documents, allowing the enrichment and the population of the target ontology. To design such a transformation, the current research field establishes connections between OWL constructs (classes, predicates, simple or complex data types, etc.) and XML constructs (elements, attributes, element lists, etc.). Two different approaches for the transformation process are exposed. The instance approaches are based on XML documents without any schema associated. The validation approaches are based on the XML schema and document validated by the associated schema. The second approaches benefit from the schema definition to provide automated transformations with logic constraints. Both approaches are discussed in the text.","['Christophe Cruz', 'Safia Nait Bahloul', 'Mokhtaria Hacherouf']",10.1177/0165551514565972,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0165551514565972,2,2015,Transforming XML documents to OWL ontologies: A survey,Journal of Information Science,"(['Library and Information Sciences', 'Information Systems'],)",,Artificial Intelligence

"Ontologies have become a key element since many decades in information systems such as in epidemiological surveillance domain. Building domain ontologies requires the access to domain knowledge owned by domain experts or contained in knowledge sources. However, domain experts are not always available for interviews. Therefore, there is a lot of value in using ontology learning which consists in automatic or semi-automatic extraction of ontological knowledge from structured or unstructured knowledge sources such as texts, databases, etc. Many techniques have been used but they all are limited in concepts, properties and terminology extraction leaving behind axioms and rules. Source code which naturally embed domain knowledge is rarely used. In this paper, we propose an approach based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for concepts, properties, axioms and rules learning from Java source code. This approach is experimented with the source code of EPICAM, an epidemiological platform developed in Java and used in Cameroon for tuberculosis surveillance. Domain experts involved in the evaluation estimated that knowledge extracted was relevant to the domain. In addition, we performed an automatic evaluation of the relevance of the terms extracted to the medical domain by aligning them with ontologies hosted on Bioportal platform through the Ontology Recommender tool. The results were interesting since the terms extracted were covered at 82.9% by many biomedical ontologies such as NCIT, SNOWMEDCT and ONTOPARON.","['Maurice Tchuente', 'Gaoussou Camara', 'Azanzi Jiomekong']",10.1515/comp-2019-0013,https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/comp-2019-0013/html,0,2019,Extracting ontological knowledge from Java source code using Hidden Markov Models,Open Computer Science ,"(['General Computer Science'],)",,Artificial Intelligence
"Data preprocessing is an important component of machine learning pipelines, which requires ample time and resources. An integral part of preprocessing is data transformation into the format required by a given learning algorithm. This paper outlines some of the modern data processing techniques used in relational learning that enable data fusion from different input data types and formats into a single table data representation, focusing on the propositionalization and embedding data transformation approaches. While both approaches aim at transforming data into tabular data format, they use different terminology and task definitions, are perceived to address different goals, and are used in different contexts. This paper contributes a unifying framework that allows for improved understanding of these two data transformation techniques by presenting their unified definitions, and by explaining the similarities and differences between the two approaches as variants of a unified complex data transformation task. In addition to the unifying framework, the novelty of this paper is a unifying methodology combining propositionalization and embeddings, which benefits from the advantages of both in solving complex data transformation and learning tasks. We present two efficient implementations of the unifying methodology: an instance-based PropDRM approach, and a feature-based PropStar approach to data transformation and learning, together with their empirical evaluation on several relational problems. The results show that the new algorithms can outperform existing relational learners and can solve much larger problems.","['Marko Robnik-Šikonja', 'Blaž Škrlj', 'Nada Lavrač']",10.1007/s10994-020-05890-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10994-020-05890-8,6,2020,Propositionalization and embeddings: two sides of the same coin,Machine learning,"(['Artificial Intelligence', 'Software'],)",,Artificial Intelligence

"Learning Analytics by nature relies on computational information processing activities intended to extract from raw data some interesting aspects that can be used to obtain insights into the behaviours of learners, the design of learning experiences, etc. There is a large variety of computational techniques that can be employed, all with interesting properties, but it is the interpretation of their results that really forms the core of the analytics process. In this paper, we look at a specific data mining method, namely sequential pattern extraction, and we demonstrate an approach that exploits available linked open data for this interpretation task. Indeed, we show through a case study relying on data about students' enrolment in course modules how linked data can be used to provide a variety of additional dimensions through which the results of the data mining method can be explored, providing, at interpretation time, new input into the analytics process.",,10.1145/2460296.2460327,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/18cc60d4d21eb70159e9b2c1154d12a7682cb892,0,2013,"Interpreting data mining results with linked data for learning analytics: motivation, case study and direction",LAK '13,,['Computer Science'],Artificial Intelligence
"Linked Data is an open data space that emerges from the publication and interlinking of structured data on the Web using the Semantic Web technologies. How to utilize this wealth of data is currently a focused research theme of the Semantic Web community. In this paper, we aim to utilize Linked Data to generate semantic annotations for frequent patterns extracted from textual documents. First, we extract semantic relations from textual documents and merge them into a set of semantic graphs. Then, we apply a frequent subgraph discovery algorithm on the set of graphs to generate frequent patterns. Finally, we annotate the discovered patterns using Linked Data. Our approach can be applied in such domains as terrorist network analysis and biological network analysis. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through an empirical experiment that discovers and validates relationships between political figures from large number of news on the Web.",,10.1109/NCM.2009.131,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ac1bbe9797670045c8a57f89879d0cce81dda241,0,2009,Semantic text mining with linked data,"2009 Fifth International Joint Conference on INC, IMS and IDC",,['Computer Science'],Artificial Intelligence

"Background            We address the goal of curating observations from published experiments in a generalizable form; reasoning over these observations to generate interpretations and then querying this interpreted knowledge to supply the supporting evidence. We present web-application software as part of the 'BioScholar' project (R01-GM083871) that fully instantiates this process for a well-defined domain: using tract-tracing experiments to study the neural connectivity of the rat brain.                                Results            The main contribution of this work is to provide the first instantiation of a knowledge representation for experimental observations called 'Knowledge Engineering from Experimental Design' (KEfED) based on experimental variables and their interdependencies. The software has three parts: (a) the KEfED model editor - a design editor for creating KEfED models by drawing a flow diagram of an experimental protocol; (b) the KEfED data interface - a spreadsheet-like tool that permits users to enter experimental data pertaining to a specific model; (c) a 'neural connection matrix' interface that presents neural connectivity as a table of ordinal connection strengths representing the interpretations of tract-tracing data. This tool also allows the user to view experimental evidence pertaining to a specific connection. BioScholar is built in Flex 3.5. It uses Persevere (a noSQL database) as a flexible data store and PowerLoom® (a mature First Order Logic reasoning system) to execute queries using spatial reasoning over the BAMS neuroanatomical ontology.                                Conclusions            We first introduce the KEfED approach as a general approach and describe its possible role as a way of introducing structured reasoning into models of argumentation within new models of scientific publication. We then describe the design and implementation of our example application: the BioScholar software. This is presented as a possible biocuration interface and supplementary reasoning toolkit for a larger, more specialized bioinformatics system: the Brain Architecture Management System (BAMS).",,10.1186/1471-2105-12-351,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-12-351,0,2011,Knowledge engineering tools for reasoning with scientific observations and interpretations: a neural connectivity use case,['BMC Bioinformatics'],"(['Applied Mathematics', 'Computer Science Applications', 'Molecular Biology', 'Biochemistry', 'Structural Biology'],)",,Artificial Intelligence

"In this paper we present ExpLOD, a framework which exploits the information available in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud to generate a natural language explanation of the suggestions produced by a recommendation algorithm. The methodology is based on building a graph in which the items liked by a user are connected to the items recommended through the properties available in the LOD cloud. Next, given this graph, we implemented some techniques to rank those properties and we used the most relevant ones to feed a module for generating explanations in natural language. In the experimental evaluation we performed a user study with 308 subjects aiming to investigate to what extent our explanation framework can lead to more transparent, trustful and engaging recommendations. The preliminary results provided us with encouraging findings, since our algorithm performed better than both a non-personalized explanation baseline and a popularity-based one.",,10.1145/2959100.2959173,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/48bbae4041caebfbb822de024417a90da7a4efe1,0,2016,Explod: a framework for explaining recommendations based on the linked open data cloud,RecSys,,['Computer Science'],Artificial Intelligence

"Providing model-generated explanations in recommender systems is important to user experience. State-of-the-art recommendation algorithms—especially the collaborative filtering (CF)- based approaches with shallow or deep models—usually work with various unstructured information sources for recommendation, such as textual reviews, visual images, and various implicit or explicit feedbacks. Though structured knowledge bases were considered in content-based approaches, they have been largely ignored recently due to the availability of vast amounts of data and the learning power of many complex models. However, structured knowledge bases exhibit unique advantages in personalized recommendation systems. When the explicit knowledge about users and items is considered for recommendation, the system could provide highly customized recommendations based on users’ historical behaviors and the knowledge is helpful for providing informed explanations regarding the recommended items. A great challenge for using knowledge bases for recommendation is how to integrate large-scale structured and unstructured data, while taking advantage of collaborative filtering for highly accurate performance. Recent achievements in knowledge-base embedding (KBE) sheds light on this problem, which makes it possible to learn user and item representations while preserving the structure of their relationship with external knowledge for explanation. In this work, we propose to explain knowledge-base embeddings for explainable recommendation. Specifically, we propose a knowledge-base representation learning framework to embed heterogeneous entities for recommendation, and based on the embedded knowledge base, a soft matching algorithm is proposed to generate personalized explanations for the recommended items. Experimental results on real-world e-commerce datasets verified the superior recommendation performance and the explainability power of our approach compared with state-of-the-art baselines.",,10.3390/a11090137,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/a11090137,0,2018,Learning heterogeneous knowledge base embeddings for explainable recommendation,['Algorithms'],"(['Computational Mathematics', 'Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Numerical Analysis', 'Theoretical Computer Science'],)",,Artificial Intelligence

"Recognizing textual entailment is a key task for many semantic applications, such as Question Answering, Text Summarization, and Information Extraction, among others. Entailment scenarios can range from a simple syntactic variation to more complex semantic relationships between pieces of text, but most approaches try a one-size-fits-all solution that usually favors some scenario to the detriment of another. We propose a composite approach for recognizing text entailment which analyzes the entailment pair to decide whether it must be resolved syntactically or semantically. We also make the answer interpretable: whenever an entailment is solved semantically, we explore a knowledge base composed of structured lexical definitions to generate natural language humanlike justifications, explaining the semantic relationship holding between the pieces of text. Besides outperforming wellestablished entailment algorithms, our composite approach gives an important step towards Explainable AI, using world knowledge to make the semantic reasoning process explicit and understandable.",,10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33017023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33017023,0,2019,"Exploring knowledge graphs in an interpretable composite approach for text entailment,",['Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence'],"([],)",,Artificial Intelligence

"The knowledge representation community has built general-purpose ontologies which contain large amounts of commonsense knowledge over relevant aspects of the world, including useful visual information, e.g.: ""a ball is used by a football player"", ""a tennis player is located at a tennis court"". Current state-of-the-art approaches for visual recognition do not exploit these rule-based knowledge sources. Instead, they learn recognition models directly from training examples. In this paper, we study how general-purpose ontologies—specifically, MIT's ConceptNet ontology—can improve the performance of state-of-the-art vision systems. As a testbed, we tackle the problem of sentence-based image retrieval. Our retrieval approach incorporates knowledge from ConceptNet on top of a large pool of object detectors derived from a deep learning technique. In our experiments, we show that ConceptNet can improve performance on a common benchmark dataset. Key to our performance is the use of the ESPGAME dataset to select visually relevant relations from ConceptNet. Consequently, a main conclusion of this work is that general-purpose commonsense ontologies improve performance on visual reasoning tasks when properly filtered to select meaningful visual relations.",,10.24963/ijcai.2017/178,http://dx.doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2017/178,0,2017,How a general-purpose common- sense ontology can improve performance of learning-based image retrieval,['Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence'],"([],)",,Artificial Intelligence

"Segmentation of retinal blood vessels is the first step for several computer aided-diagnosis systems (CAD), not only for ocular disease diagnosis such as diabetic retinopathy (DR) but also of non-ocular disease, such as hypertension, stroke and cardiovascular diseases. In this paper, a supervised learning-based method, using a multi-layer perceptron neural network and carefully selected vector of features, is proposed. In particular, for each pixel of a retinal fundus image, we construct a 24-D feature vector, encoding information on the local intensity, morphology transformation, principal moments of phase congruency, Hessian, and difference of Gaussian values. A post-processing technique depending on mathematical morphological operators is used to optimise the segmentation. Moreover, the selected feature vector succeeded in outfitting the symmetric features that provided the final blood vessel probability as a binary map image. The proposed method is tested on three known datasets: Digital Retinal Image for Extraction (DRIVE), Structure Analysis of the Retina (STARE), and CHASED_DB1 datasets. The experimental results, both visual and quantitative, testify to the robustness of the proposed method. This proposed method achieved 0.9607, 0.7542, and 0.9843 in DRIVE, 0.9632, 0.7806, and 0.9825 on STARE, 0.9577, 0.7585 and 0.9846 in CHASE_DB1, with respectable accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity performance metrics. Furthermore, they testify that the method is superior to seven similar state-of-the-art methods.","['Hamed Nassar', 'Gamil Abdel Azim', 'M.

"Extracting relational triples from unstructured text is crucial for large-scale knowledge graph construction. However, few existing works excel in solving the overlapping triple problem where multiple relational triples in the same sentence share the same entities. We propose a novel Hierarchical Binary Tagging (HBT) framework derived from a principled problem formulation. Instead of treating relations as discrete labels as in previous works, our new framework models relations as functions that map subjects to objects in a sentence, which naturally handles overlapping triples. Experiments show that the proposed framework already outperforms state-of-the-art methods even its encoder module uses a randomly initialized BERT encoder, showing the power of the new tagging framework. It enjoys further performance boost when employing a pretrained BERT encoder, outperforming the strongest baseline by 25.6 and 45.9 absolute gain in F1-score on two public datasets NYT and WebNLG, respectively. In-depth analysis on different types of overlapping triples shows that the method delivers consistent performance gain in all scenarios.

The indicative part of the summary identifies the topics of the document, and the informative part elaborates on some of these topics according to the reader's interest. SumUM motivates the topics, describes entities, and defines concepts. It is a first step for exploring the issue of dynamic summarization. This is accomplished through a process of shallow syntactic and semantic analysis, concept identification, and text regeneration. Our method was developed through the study of a corpus of s written by professional ors. Relying on human judgment, we have evaluated indicativeness, informativeness, and text acceptability of the automatic summaries.

"The ability to promptly recognise new research trends is strategic for many stakeholders, including universities, institutional funding bodies, academic publishers and companies. While the literature describes several approaches which aim to identify the emergence of new research topics early in their lifecycle, these rely on the assumption that the topic in question is already associated with a number of publications and consistently referred to by a community of researchers. Hence, detecting the emergence of a new research area at an embryonic stage, i.e., before the topic has been consistently labelled by a community of researchers and associated with a number of publications, is still an open challenge. In this paper, we begin to address this challenge by performing a study of the dynamics preceding the creation of new topics. This study indicates that the emergence of a new topic is anticipated by a significant increase in the pace of collaboration between relevant research areas, which can be seen as the ‘parents’ of the new topic. These initial findings (i) confirm our hypothesis that it is possible in principle to detect the emergence of a new topic at the embryonic stage, (ii) provide new empirical evidence supporting relevant theories in Philosophy of Science, and also (iii) suggest that new topics tend to emerge in an environment in which weakly interconnected research areas begin to cross-fertilise.","['Francesco Osborne', 'Angelo A.

"Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Named Entity Normalization (NEN) refer to the recognition and normalization of raw texts to known entities. From the perspective of recruitment innovation, professional skill characterization and normalization render human capital data more meaningful both commercially and socially. Accurate and detailed normalization of skills is the key for the predictive analysis of labor market dynamics. Such analytics help bridge the skills gap between employers and candidate workers by matching the right talent for the right job and identifying in-demand skills for workforce training programs. This can also work towards the social goal of providing more job opportunities to the community. In this paper we propose an automated approach for skill entity recognition and optimal normalization.","['Meng Zhao', 'Matt McNair', 'Faizan Javed', 'Ferosh Jacob']",,,3,2015,SKILL: A System for Skill Identification and Normalization,,,Computer Science,Artificial Intelligence

For the first, we use the same general machine learning approach described in Fisher and Roark (2008) for update summarization. In the second, we use a similar machine learning approach, but include sub-sentential units produced by our discourse segmenter, see Fisher and Roark (2007b), as possible units for inclusion in a summary. Interestingly, we find that one approach performs significantly better in the production of the base summary, while the other approach performs significantly better in the update summary. We then present a large-corpus entity linking system. This system expands queries using internal links within Wikipedia and link entities with minimum-spanning-tree clustering.

"Most approaches to extractive summarization define a set of features upon which selection of sentences is based, using algorithms independent of the features themselves. We propose a new set of features based on low-level, atomic events that describe relationships between important actors in a document or set of documents. We investigate the effect this new feature has on extractive summarization, compared with a baseline feature set consisting of the words in the input documents, and with state-of-the-art summarization systems. Our experimental results indicate that not only the event-based features offer an improvement in summary quality over words as features, but that this effect is more pronounced for more sophisticated summarization methods that avoid redundancy in the output.","['Vasileios Hatzivassiloglou', 'Elena Filatova']",10.7916/D8FJ2R3S,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f2a665c064f84a301d64a0ab79f9ed6047dc74e2,0,2004,Event-Based Extractive Summarization,,,['Computer Science'],Artificial Intelligence

"We show that by making use of information common to document sets belonging to a common category, we can improve the quality of automatically extracted content in multi-document summaries. This simple property is widely applicable in multi-document summarization tasks, and can be encapsulated by the concept of category-specific importance (CSI). Our experiments show that CSI is a valuable metric to aid sentence selection in extractive summarization tasks. We operationalize the computation CSI of sentences through the introduction of two new features that can be computed without needing any external knowledge. We also generalize this approach, showing that when manually-curated document-to-category mappings are unavailable, performing automatic categorization of document sets also improves summarization performance. We have incorporated these features into a simple, freely available, open-source extractive summarization system, called SWING. In the recent TAC-2011 guided summarization task, SWING outperformed all other participant summarization systems as measured by automated ROUGE measures.

"Automatic extraction of temporal relations between event pairs is an important task for several natural language processing applications such as Question Answering, Information Extraction, and Summarization. Since most existing methods are supervised and require large corpora, which for many languages do not exist, we have concentrated our efforts to reduce the need for annotated data as much as possible. This paper presents two different algorithms towards this goal. The first algorithm is a weakly supervised machine learning approach for classification of temporal relations between events. In the first stage, the algorithm learns a general classifier from an annotated corpus. Then, inspired by the hypothesis of ""one type of temporal relation per discourse'', it extracts useful information from a cluster of topically related documents. We show that by combining the global information of such a cluster with local decisions of a general classifier, a bootstrapping cross-document classifier can be built to extract temporal relations between events. Our experiments show that without any additional annotated data, the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is higher than that of several previous successful systems. The second proposed method for temporal relation extraction is based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Within EM, we used different techniques such as a greedy best-first search and integer linear programming for temporal inconsistency removal. We think that the experimental results of our EM based algorithm, as a first step toward a fully unsupervised temporal relation extraction method, is encouraging.","['Gholamreza Ghassem-Sani', 'Seyed Abolghasem Mirroshandel']",10.1613/jair.3693,http://dx.doi.org/10.1613/jair.3693,9,2012,Towards Unsupervised Learning of Temporal Relations between Events,Journal Of Artificial Intelligence Research,"(['Artificial Intelligence'],)",,Artificial Intelligence

"With the increasing amount of semantic data available on the web there is a strong need for systems that allow common web users to access this body of knowledge. Especially question answering systems have received wide attention, as they allow users to express arbitrarily complex information needs in an easy and intuitive fashion (for an overview see [4]). The key challenge lies in translating the users' information needs into a form such that they can be evaluated using standard Semantic Web query processing and inferencing techniques. Over the past years, a range of approaches have been developed to address this challenge, showing signicant advances towards answering natural language questions with respect to large, heterogeneous sets of structured data. However, only few systems yet address the fact that the structured data available nowadays is distributed among a large collection of interconnected datasets, and that answers to questions can often only be provided if information from several sources are combined. In addition, a lot of information is still available only in textual form, both on the web and in the form of labels and s in linked data sources. Therefore approaches are needed that can not only deal with the specific character of structured data but also with finding information in several sources, processing both structured and unstructured information, and combining such gathered information into one answer. The main objective of the open challenge on question answering over linked data (QALD) is to provide up-to-date, demanding benchmarks that establish a standard against which question answering systems over structured data can be evaluated and compared. QALD-4 is the fourth instalment of the QALD open challenge, comprising three tasks: multilingual question answering, biomedical question answering over interlinked data, and hybrid question answering.

"Open educational resources are currently becoming increasingly available from a multitude of sources and are consequently annotated in many diverse ways. Interoperability concerns that naturally arise can often be resolved through the semantification of metadata descriptions, while at the same time strengthening the knowledge value of resources. SKOS can be a solid linking point offering a standard vocabulary for thematic descriptions, by referencing semantic thesauri. We propose the enhancement and maintenance of educational resources’ metadata in the form of learning object ontologies and introduce the notion of a learning object ontology repository that can help towards their publication, discovery and reuse. At the same time, linking to thesauri datasets and contextualized sources interrelates learning objects with linked data and exposes them to the Web of Data. We build a set of extensions and workflows on top of contemporary ontology management tools, such as WebProtégé, that can make it suitable as a learning object ontology repository. The proposed approach and implementation can help libraries and universities in discovering, managing and incorporating open educational resources and enhancing current curricula.","['Georgia D Solomou', 'Dimitrios A Koutsomitropoulos']",10.1177/0340035217737559,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0340035217737559,0,2018,A learning object ontology repository to support annotation and discovery of educational resources using semantic thesauri,IFLA journal,"(['Library and Information Sciences'],)",,Databases/Information Systems

"Static analysis is a fundamental task in query optimization. In this article we study static analysis and optimization techniques for SPARQL, which is the standard language for querying Semantic Web data. Of particular interest for us is the            optionality            feature in SPARQL. It is crucial in Semantic Web data management, where data sources are inherently incomplete and the user is usually interested in partial answers to queries. This feature is one of the most complicated constructors in SPARQL and also the one that makes this language depart from classical query languages such as relational conjunctive queries. We focus on the class of well-designed SPARQL queries, which has been proposed in the literature as a fragment of the language with good properties regarding query evaluation. We first propose a tree representation for SPARQL queries, called pattern trees, which captures the class of well-designed SPARQL graph patterns. Among other results, we propose several rules that can be used to transform pattern trees into a simple normal form, and study equivalence and containment. We also study the evaluation and enumeration problems for this class of queries.","['Sebastian Skritek', 'Reinhard Pichler', 'Jorge Pérez', 'Andrés Letelier']",10.1145/2500130,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2500130,11,2013,Static analysis and optimization of semantic web queries,ACM Transactions on Database Systems,"(['Information Systems'],)",,Databases/Information Systems

"Gamification is the use of game design elements in nongame contexts and has been shown to be effective in motivating behavior change. By seeing game elements as “motivational affordances,” and formalizing the relationship between these elements and motivational affordances, it is the position of this article that gamification can be effectively applied to improve software systems across many different application domains. The research reported here aims to formalize the relationship between game elements and motivation, toward making gamification’s use more systematic. The focus is on the development of a framework linking commonly occurring game elements with the components of a psychological motivational model known as the self-determination theory, coupled with a proposed framework of commonly occurring game elements. The goal is to inform system designers who would like to leverage gamification of the game elements they would need to employ as motivational affordances.","['Liam Murray', 'Geraldine Exton', 'Chris Exton', 'Tabea DeWille', 'Jim Buckley']",10.1177/0047239518783153,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0047239518783153,6,2018,A Gamification–Motivation Design Framework for Educational Software Developers,Journal of Educational Technology Systems,"([],)",,Databases/Information Systems

"One of the key channels of scholarly knowledge exchange are scholarly events such as conferences, workshops, symposiums, etc.; such events are especially important and popular in Computer Science, Engineering, and Natural Sciences.However, scholars encounter problems in finding relevant information about upcoming events and statistics on their historic evolution.In order to obtain a better understanding of scholarly event characteristics in four fields of science, we analyzed the metadata of scholarly events of four major fields of science, namely Computer Science, Physics, Engineering, and Mathematics using Scholarly Events Quality Assessment suite, a suite of ten metrics.In particular, we analyzed renowned scholarly events belonging to five sub-fields within Computer Science, namely World Wide Web, Computer Vision, Software Engineering, Data Management, as well as Security and Privacy.This analysis is based on a systematic approach using descriptive statistics as well as exploratory data analysis. The findings are on the one hand interesting to observe the general evolution and success factors of scholarly events; on the other hand, they allow (prospective) event organizers, publishers, and committee members to assess the progress of their event over time and compare it to other events in the same field; and finally, they help researchers to make more informed decisions when selecting suitable venues for presenting their work.Based on these findings, a set of recommendations has been concluded to different stakeholders, involving event organizers, potential authors, proceedings publishers, and sponsors.

"<jats:title content-type=""-subheading"">PurposeResearch data publishing is today widely regarded as crucial for reproducibility, proper assessment of scientific results, and as a way for researchers to get proper credit for sharing their data. However, several challenges need to be solved to fully realize its potential, one of them being the development of a global standard for links between research data and literature. Current linking solutions are mostly based on bilateral, ad hoc agreements between publishers and data centers. These operate in silos so that content cannot be readily combined to deliver a network graph connecting research data and literature in a comprehensive and reliable way. The Research Data Alliance (RDA) Publishing Data Services Working Group (PDS-WG) aims to address this issue of fragmentation by bringing together different stakeholders to agree on a common infrastructure for sharing links between datasets and literature. The paper aims to discuss these issues.<jats:title content-type=""-subheading"">Design/methodology/approachThis paper presents the synergic effort of the RDA PDS-WG and the OpenAIRE infrastructure toward enabling a common infrastructure for exchanging data-literature links by realizing and operating the Data-Literature Interlinking (DLI) Service. The DLI Service populates and provides access to a graph of data set-literature links (at the time of writing close to five million, and growing) collected from a variety of major data centers, publishers, and research organizations.<jats:title content-type=""-subheading"">FindingsTo achieve its objectives, the Service proposes an interoperable exchange data model and format, based on which it collects and publishes links, thereby offering the opportunity to validate such common approach on real-case scenarios, with real providers and consumers. Feedback of these actors will drive continuous refinement of the both data model and exchange format, supporting the further development of the Service to become an essential part of a universal, open, cross-platform, cross-discipline solution for collecting, and sharing data set-literature links.<jats:title content-type=""-subheading"">Originality/valueThis realization of the DLI Service is the first technical, cross-community, and collaborative effort in the direction of establishing a common infrastructure for facilitating the exchange of data set-literature links. As a result of its operation and underlying community effort, a new activity, name Scholix, has been initiated involving the technological level stakeholders such as DataCite and CrossRef.","['Uwe Schindler', 'Michael Diepenbroek', 'Amir Aryani', 'Sandro La Bruzzo', 'Paolo Manghi', 'Hylke Koers', 'Adrian Burton']",10.1108/prog-06-2016-0048,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/prog-06-2016-0048,4,2017,The data-literature interlinking service: Towards a common infrastructure for sharing data-article links,Program: electronic library and information systems,"(['Library and Information Sciences', 'Information Systems'],)",,Databases/Information Systems

"Knowledge bases (KBs), pragmatic collections of knowledge about notable entities, are an important asset in applications such as search, question answering and dialogue. Rooted in a long tradition in knowledge representation, all popular KBs only store positive information, but abstain from taking any stance towards statements not contained in them. In this paper, we make the case for explicitly stating interesting statements which are not true. Negative statements would be important to overcome current limitations of question answering, yet due to their potential abundance, any effort towards compiling them needs a tight coupling with ranking. We introduce two approaches towards automatically compiling negative statements. (i) In peer-based statistical inferences, we compare entities with highly related entities in order to derive potential negative statements, which we then rank using supervised and unsupervised features. (ii) In pattern-based query log extraction, we use a pattern-based approach for harvesting search engine query logs. Experimental results show that both approaches hold promising and complementary potential. Along with this paper, we publish the first datasets on interesting negative information, containing over 1.4M statements for 130K popular Wikidata entities.","['Gerhard Weikum', 'Simon Razniewski', 'Hiba Arnaout']",10.24432/C5101K,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8e0a05c91561c083a7865dde3e54c505c31fc61e,0,2020,Enriching Knowledge Bases with Interesting Negative Statements,Automated Knowledge Base Construction (AKBC),,['Computer Science'],Databases/Information Systems

"Name ambiguity stems from the fact that many people or objects share identical names in the real world. Such name ambiguity decreases the performance of document retrieval, Web search, information integration, and may cause confusion in other applications. Due to the same name spellings and lack of information, it is a nontrivial task to distinguish them accurately. In this article, we focus on investigating the problem in digital libraries to distinguish publications written by authors with identical names. We present an effective framework named GHOST (abbreviation for GrapHical framewOrk for name diSambiguaTion), to solve the problem systematically. We devise a novel similarity metric, and utilize only one type of attribute (i.e., coauthorship) in GHOST. Given the similarity matrix, intermediate results are grouped into clusters with a recently introduced powerful clustering algorithm called            Affinity Propagation            . In addition, as a complementary technique, user feedback can be used to enhance the performance. We evaluated the framework on the real DBLP and PubMed datasets, and the experimental results show that GHOST can achieve both high            precision            and            recall            .","['Lizhu Zhou', 'Xu Pu', 'Xiaoming Fan', 'Bing Lv', 'Jianyong Wang']",10.1145/1891879.1891883,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1891879.1891883,2,2011,On Graph-Based Name Disambiguation,['Journal of Data and Information Quality'],"(['Information Systems and Management', 'Information Systems'],)",,Databases/Information Systems

"A fast global approach that encodes haptic surface relief detail using an image-based Hybrid Rugosity Mesostructure Atlas (HyRMA) shell is presented. It is based on a depth/normal texture computed from surfacedifferences of the same mesh object at different resolutions (a dense one with thousands/millions of triangles, and a highly decimated version). Per-face local depth differences are warped from volume space into tangent space, and stored in a sorted relief atlas. Next, the atlas is sampled by a vertex/fragment shader pair, unwarped,displacing the pixels at each face of the decimated mesh to render the original mesh detail with quite fewer triangles. We achieve accurate correspondence between visualization of surface detail and perception of itsfine features without compromising rendering framerates, with some loss of detail at mesostructure â€œholesâ€•.","['Marta Fairén', 'Isabel Navazo', 'Víctor Theoktisto']",10.5220/0004299301910196,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/43652d4e10de1b7ba5e9a3aebc33530223242738,2,2013,Generalized Haptic Relief Atlas for Rendering Surface Detail,"INSTICC SciTePress Proceedings of the 8th International Joint Conference on Computer Vision, Imaging & Computer Graphics Theory and Applications, GRAPP 2013. pp. 1–6.

"Component-based software development needs to formalize a process of generation, evaluation andselection of Composite COTS-based Software Systems (CCSS), enabling software architects to make earlydecisions; the Azimut approach and its associated software tool were proposed to tackle this problem.This article presents an experimental study conduced to compare Azimut approach with a SystematizedAd-Hoc approach, regarding generated solutions quality, cost and e®ort. Results suggest that: (1) Azimutgenerate better quality solutions at lower cost, but not statistically signi¯cant, and (2) there is strongevidence showing that the e®ort required is higher than for Systematized Ad-Hoc approach; re-samplingmethods (Bootstrap and Jackknife) were applied to reinforce these conclusions.

"PurposeThis paper introduces the Research Articles in Simplified HTML (or RASH), which is a Web-first format for writing HTML-based scholarly papers; it is accompanied by the RASH Framework, a set of tools for interacting with RASH-based articles. The paper also presents an evaluation that involved authors and reviewers of RASH articles submitted to the SAVE-SD 2015 and SAVE-SD 2016 workshops.DesignRASH has been developed aiming to: be easy to learn and use; share scholarly documents (and embedded semantic annotations) through the Web; support its adoption within the existing publishing workflow.FindingsThe evaluation study confirmed that RASH is ready to be adopted in workshops, conferences, and journals and can be quickly learnt by researchers who are familiar with HTML.Research LimitationsThe evaluation study also highlighted some issues in the adoption of RASH, and in general of HTML formats, especially by less technically savvy users. Moreover, additional tools are needed, e.g., for enabling additional conversions from/to existing formats such as OpenXML.Practical ImplicationsRASH (and its Framework) is another step towards enabling the definition of formal representations of the meaning of the content of an article, facilitating its automatic discovery, enabling its linking to semantically related articles, providing access to data within the article in actionable form, and allowing integration of data between papers.Social ImplicationsRASH addresses the intrinsic needs related to the various users of a scholarly article: researchers (focussing on its content), readers (experiencing new ways for browsing it), citizen scientists (reusing available data formally defined within it through semantic annotations), publishers (using the advantages of new technologies as envisioned by the Semantic Publishing movement).ValueRASH helps authors to focus on the organisation of their texts, supports them in the task of semantically enriching the content of articles, and leaves all the issues about validation, visualisation, conversion, and semantic data extraction to the various tools developed within its Framework.","['Enrico Motta', 'Silvio Peroni', 'Francesco Osborne', 'Angelo Di Iorio', 'Andrea Giovanni Nuzzolese', 'Francesco Poggi', 'Fabio Vitali']",10.7717/peerj-cs.132,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.132,10,2017,Research Articles in Simplified HTML: a Web-first format for HTML-based scholarly articles,['PeerJ Computer Science'],"(['General Computer Science'],)",,Graphics

"With the development of Semantic Web in recent years, an increasing amount of semantic data has been created in form of Resource Description Framework (RDF). Current visualization techniques help users quickly understand the underlying RDF data by displaying its structure in an overview. However, detailed information can only be accessed by further navigation. An alternative approach is to display the global context as well as the local details simultaneously in a unified view. This view supports the visualization and navigation on RDF data in an integrated way. In this demonstration, we present ZoomRDF, a framework that: i) adapts a space-optimized visualization algorithm for RDF, which allows more resources to be displayed, thus maximizes the utilization of display space, ii) combines the visualization with a fisheye zooming concept, which assigns more space to some individual nodes while still preserving the overview structure of the data, iii) considers both the importance of resources and the user interaction on them, which offers more display space to those elements the user may be interested in. We implement the framework based on the Gene Ontology and demonstrate that it facilitates tasks like RDF data exploration and editing.","['K. Zhang', 'Y. Yu', 'H. Wang', 'D. T.

"Research on visualizing Semantic Web data has yielded many tools that rely on information visualization techniques to better support the user in understanding and editing these data. Most tools structure the visualization according to the concept definitions and interrelations that constitute the ontology’s vocabulary. Instances are often treated as somewhat peripheral information, when considered at all. These instances, that populate ontologies, represent an essential part of any knowledge base. Understanding instance-level data might be easier for users because of their higher concreteness, but instances will often be orders of magnitude more numerous than the concept definitions that give them machine-processable meaning. As such, the visualization of instance-level data poses different but real challenges. The authors present a visualization technique designed to enable users to visualize large instance sets and the relations that connect them. This visualization uses both node-link and adjacency matrix representations of graphs to visualize different parts of the data depending on their semantic and local structural properties. The technique was originally devised for simple social network visualization. The authors extend it to handle the richer and more complex graph structures of populated ontologies, exploiting ontological knowledge to drive the layout of, and navigation in, the representation embedded in a smooth zoomable environment.","['E.

"As analysts still grapple with understanding core damage accident progression at Three Mile Island and Fukushima that caught the nuclear industry off-guard once too many times, one notices the very limited detail with which the large reactor cores of these subject reactors have been modelled in their severe accident simulation code packages. At the same time, modelling of CANDU severe accidents have largely borrowed from and suffered from the limitations of the same LWR codes (see IAEA TECDOC 1727) whose applications to PHWRs have poorly caught critical PHWR design specifics and vulnerabilities. As a result, accident management measures that have been instituted at CANDU PHWRs, while meeting the important industry objective of publically seeming to be doing something about lessons learnt from say Fukushima and showing that the reactor designs are oh so close to perfect and the off-site consequences of severe accidents happily benign.               Integrated PHWR severe accident progression and consequence assessment code ROSHNI can make a significant contribution to actual, practical understanding of severe accident progression in CANDU PHWRs, improving significantly on the other PHWR specific computer codes developed three decades ago when modeling decisions were constrained by limited computing power and poor understanding of and interest in severe core damage accidents. These codes force gross simplifications in reactor core modelling and do not adequately represent all the right CANDU core details, materials, fluids, vessels or phenomena. But they produce results that are familiar and palatable. They do, however to their credit, also excel in their computational speed, largely because they model and compute so little and with such un-necessary simplifications.               ROSHNI sheds most previous modelling simplifications and represents each of the 380 channels, 4560 bundle, 37 elements in four concentric ring, Zircaloy clad fuel geometry, materials and fluids more faithfully in a 2000 MW(Th) CANDU6 reactor. It can be used easily for other PHWRs with different number of fuel channels and bundles per each channel. Each of horizontal PHWR reactor channels with all their bundles, fuel rings, sheaths, appendages, end fittings and feeders are modelled and in detail that reflects large across core differences. While other codes model at best a few hundred core fuel entities, thermo-chemical transient behaviour of about 73,000 different fuel channel entities within the core is considered by ROSHNI simultaneously along with other 15,000 or so other flow path segments. At each location all known thermo-chemical and hydraulic phenomena are computed. With such detail, ROSHNI is able to provide information on their progressive and parallel thermo-chemical contribution to accident progression and a more realistic fission product release source term that would belie the miniscule one (100 TBq of Cs-137 or 0.15% of core inventory) used by EMOs now in Canada on recommendation of our national regulator CNSC. ROSHNI has an advanced, more CANDU specific consideration of each bundle transitioning to a solid debris behaviour in the Calandria vessel without reverting to a simplified molten corium formulation that happily ignores interaction of debris with vessel welds, further vessel failures and energetic interactions. The code is able to follow behaviour of each fuel bundle following its disassembly from the fuel channel and thus demonstrate that the gross assumption of a core collapse made in some analyses is wrong and misleading. It is able to thus demonstrate that PHWR core disassembly is not only gradual, it will be also be incomplete with a large number of low power, peripheral fuel channels never disassembling under most credible scenarios.               The code is designed to grow into and use its voluminous results in a severe accident simulator for operator training. It’s phenomenological models are able to examine design inadequacies / issues that affect accident progression and several simple to implement design improvements that have a profound effect on results. For example, an early pressure boundary failure due to inadequacy of heat sinks in a station blackout scenario can be examined along with the effect of improved and adequate over pressure protection.               A best effort code such as ROSHNI can be instrumental in identifying the risk reduction benefits of undertaking certain design, operational and accidental management improvements for PHWRs, with some of the multi-unit ones handicapped by poor pressurizer placement and leaky containments with vulnerable materials, poor overpressure protection, ad-hoc mitigation measures and limited instrumentation common to all CANDUs. Case in point is the PSA supported design and installed number of Hydrogen recombiners that are neither for the right gas (designed mysteriously for H2 instead of D2) or its potential release quantity (they are sparse and will cause explosions).               The paper presents ROSHNI results of simulations of a postulated station blackout scenario and sheds a light on the challenges ahead in minimizing risk from operation of these otherwise unique power reactors.","['YongMann Song', 'Sunil Nijhawan']",10.1115/icone2020-16633,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/icone2020-16633,8,2020,Simulation of Severe Accident Progression Using ROSHNI: A New Integrated Simulation Code for PHWR Severe Accidents,Volume 1: Beyond Design Basis; Codes and Standards; Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD); Decontamination and Decommissioning; Nuclear Fuel and Engineering; Nuclear Plant Engineering,"([],)",,Numerical Analysis/Scientific Computing

"Epidemiological surveillance systems enable collection, analysis and dissemination of information on the monitored disease to different stakeholders. It may be done manually or using a software. Given the poor performances of manual systems, the software approach is generally adopted. Epidemiological surveillance systems are based on existing softwares, softwares developed from scratch given the specifications or softwares provided by a vendor. These solutions are not always suitable because epidemiological surveillance systems evolve quickly (new drugs, new treatment protocols, etc.), leading to software updates, which can take time (while waiting for a new version) and be expensive. In this article, we present the use of the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) approach to model and generate epidemiological surveillance systems. The result is a complete MDA based methodology and tool to develop epidemiological surveillance systems.

"To build needed mobile applications in specific domains, requirements should be collected and analyzed in holistic approach. However, resource is limited for small vendor groups to perform holistic requirement acquisition and elicitation. The rise of crowdsourcing and crowdfunding gives small vendor groups new opportunities to build needed mobile applications for the crowd. By finding prior stakeholders and gathering requirements effectively from the crowd, mobile application projects can establish sound foundation in early phase of software process. Therefore, integration of crowd-based requirement engineering into software process is important for small vendor groups. Conventional requirement acquisition and elicitation methods are analyst-centric. Very little discussion is in adapting requirement acquisition tools for crowdcentric context. In this study, several tool features of use case documentation are revised in crowd-centric context. These features constitute a use case-based framework, called UCFrame, for crowd-centric requirement acquisition. An instantiation of UCFrame is also presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of UCFrame in collecting crowd requirements for building two mobile applications.","['Hewijin Christine Jiau', 'Wei-Chung Hu']",10.1145/2894784.2894795,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2894784.2894795,5,2016,UCFrame: A Use Case Framework for Crowd-Centric Requirement Acquisition,ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes,"([],)",,Software Engineering

"Authentication systems based on biometrics characteristics and data represents one of the most important trend in the evolution of the society, e.g., Smart City, Internet-of-Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Big Data. In the near future, biometrics systems will be everywhere in the society, such as government, education, smart cities, banks etc. Due to its uniqueness, characteristic, biometrics systems will become more and more vulnerable, privacy being one of the most important challenges. The classic cryptographic primitives are not sufficient to assure a strong level of secureness for privacy. The current paper has several objectives. The main objective consists in creating a framework based on cryptographic modules which can be applied in systems with biometric authentication methods. The technologies used in creating the framework are: C#, Java, C++, Python, and Haskell. The wide range of technologies for developing the algorithms give the readers the possibility and not only, to choose the proper modules for their own research or business direction. The cryptographic modules contain algorithms based on machine learning and modern cryptographic algorithms: AES (Advanced Encryption System), SHA-256, RC4, RC5, RC6, MARS, BLOWFISH, TWOFISH, THREEFISH, RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), Elliptic Curve, and Diffie Hellman. As methods for implementing with success the cryptographic modules, we will propose a methodology which can be used as a how-to guide. The article will focus only on the first category, machine learning, and data clustering, algorithms with applicability in the cloud computing environment. For tests we have used a virtual machine (Virtual Box) with Apache Hadoop and a Biometric Analysis Tool. The weakness of the algorithms and methods implemented within the framework will be evaluated and presented in order for the reader to acknowledge the latest status of the security analysis and the vulnerabilities founded in the mentioned algorithms. Another important result of the authors consists in creating a scheme for biometric enrollment (in Results). The purpose of the scheme is to give a big overview on how to use it, step by step, in real life, and how to use the algorithms. In the end, as a conclusion, the current work paper gives a comprehensive background on the most important and challenging aspects on how to design and implement an authentication system based on biometrics characteristics.","['Valentin Pau', 'Marius Mihailescu', 'Stefania Nita']",10.3390/cryptography2040039,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cryptography2040039,12,2018,Security and Cryptographic Challenges for Authentication Based on Biometrics Data,Cryptography,"([],)",,Software Engineering
"MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large datasets that is amenable to a broad variety of real-world tasks. Users specify the computation in terms of a            map            and a            reduce            function, and the underlying runtime system automatically parallelizes the computation across large-scale clusters of machines, handles machine failures, and schedules inter-machine communication to make efficient use of the network and disks. Programmers find the system easy to use: more than ten thousand distinct MapReduce programs have been implemented internally at Google over the past four years, and an average of one hundred thousand MapReduce jobs are executed on Google's clusters every day, processing a total of more than twenty petabytes of data per day.","['Sanjay Ghemawat', 'Jeffrey Dean']",10.1145/1327452.1327492,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1327452.1327492,1,2008,MapReduce: simplified data processing on large clusters,Communications of the ACM,"(['General Computer Science'],)",,Software Engineering

"An encryption method is presented with the novel property that publicly revealing an encryption key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption key. This has two important consequences: (1) Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intented recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. (2) A message can be “signed” using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in “electronic mail” and “electronic funds transfer” systems. A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product,            n            , of two large secret primer numbers p and q. Decryption is similar; only a different, secret, power d is used, where e * d ≡ 1(mod (p - 1) * (q - 1)). The security of the system rests in part on the difficulty of factoring the published divisor,            n            .","['L. Adleman', 'A. Shamir', 'R. L.

". This study describes the utility of Earth Observation (EO)-1 Hyperion data for sub-pixel mineral investigation using Mixture Tuned Target Constrained Interference Minimized Filter (MTTCIMF) algorithm in hostile mountainous terrain of Rajsamand district of Rajasthan, which hosts economic mineralization such as lead, zinc, and copper etc. The study encompasses pre-processing, data reduction, Pixel Purity Index (PPI) and endmember extraction from reflectance image of surface minerals such as illite, montmorillonite, phlogopite, dolomite and chlorite. These endmembers were then assessed with USGS mineral spectral library and lab spectra of rock samples collected from field for spectral inspection. Subsequently, MTTCIMF algorithm was implemented on processed image to obtain mineral distribution map of each detected mineral. A virtual verification method has been adopted to evaluate the classified image, which uses directly image information to evaluate the result and confirm the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 68 % and 0.6 respectively. The sub-pixel level mineral information with reasonable accuracy could be a valuable guide to geological and exploration community for expensive ground and/or lab experiments to discover economic deposits. Thus, the study demonstrates the feasibility of Hyperion data for sub-pixel mineral mapping using MTTCIMF algorithm with cost and time effective approach.","['R. Sharma', 'P. K. Champatiray', 'S.

"In the present study, we have attempted the delineation of limestone using different spectral mapping algorithms in ASTER data. Each spectral mapping algorithm derives limestone exposure map independently. Although these spectral maps are broadly similar to each other, they are also different at places in terms of spatial disposition of limestone pixels. Therefore, an attempt is made to integrate the results of these spectral maps to derive an integrated map using minimum noise fraction (MNF) method. The first MNF image is the result of two cascaded principal component methods suitable for preserving complementary information derived from each spectral map. While implementing MNF, noise or non-coherent pixels occurring within a homogeneous patch of limestone are removed first using shift difference method, before attempting principal component analysis on input spectral maps for deriving composite spectral map of limestone exposures. The limestone exposure map is further validated based on spectral data and ancillary geological data.","[' Reshma Parveen', ' E. N. Dhananjaya Rao', ' K.

". We describe here the development and evaluation of an Earth system model suitable for centennial-scale climate prediction. The principal new components added to the physical climate model are the terrestrial and ocean ecosystems and gas-phase tropospheric chemistry, along with their coupled interactions.  The individual Earth system components are described briefly and the relevant interactions between the components are explained. Because the multiple interactions could lead to unstable feedbacks, we go through a careful process of model spin up to ensure that all components are stable and the interactions balanced. This spun-up configuration is evaluated against observed data for the Earth system components and is generally found to perform very satisfactorily. The reason for the evaluation phase is that the model is to be used for the core climate simulations carried out by the Met Office Hadley Centre for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), so it is essential that addition of the extra complexity does not detract substantially from its climate performance. Localised changes in some specific meteorological variables can be identified, but the impacts on the overall simulation of present day climate are slight.  This model is proving valuable both for climate predictions, and for investigating the strengths of biogeochemical feedbacks.","['S. Woodward', 'F. O&amp;apos;Connor', 'G. Martin', 'M. Joshi', 'J.

"River-lake systems comprise chains of lakes connected by rivers and streams that flow into and out of them. The contact zone between a lake and a river can act as a barrier, where inflowing matter is accumulated and transformed. Magnesium and calcium are natural components of surface water, and their concentrations can be shaped by various factors, mostly the geological structure of a catchment area, soil class and type, plant cover, weather conditions (precipitation-evaporation, seasonal variations), land relief, type and intensity of water supply (surface runoffs and groundwater inflows), etc. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of a river-lake system on magnesium and calcium concentrations in surface water (inflows, lake, outflow) and their accumulation in bottom deposits. The study was performed between March 2011 and May 2014 in a river-lake system comprising Lake Symsar with inflows, lying in the Olsztyn Lakeland region. The study revealed that calcium and magnesium were retained in the water column and the bottom deposits of the lake at 12.75 t Mg year-1 and 1.97 t Ca year-1. On average, 12.7±1.2 g of calcium and 1.77±0.9 g of magnesium accumulated in 1 kg of bottom deposits in Lake Symsar. The river-lake system, which received pollutants from an agricultural catchment, influenced the Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations in the water and the bottom deposits of Lake Symsar. The Tolknicka Struga drainage canal, to which incompletely treated municipal wastewater was discharged, also affected Ca2+ and Mg2+ levels, thus indicating the significant influence of anthropogenic factors.","['Szymczyk S.', 'Potasznik, A.

"The fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) will produce a state-of-the- art multimodel dataset designed to advance our knowledge of climate variability and climate change. Researchers worldwide are analyzing the model output and will produce results likely to underlie the forthcoming Fifth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Unprecedented in scale and attracting interest from all major climate modeling groups, CMIP5 includes “long term” simulations of twentieth-century climate and projections for the twenty-first century and beyond. Conventional atmosphere–ocean global climate models and Earth system models of intermediate complexity are for the first time being joined by more recently developed Earth system models under an experiment design that allows both types of models to be compared to observations on an equal footing. Besides the longterm experiments, CMIP5 calls for an entirely new suite of “near term” simulations focusing on recent decades and the future to year 2035. These “decadal predictions” are initialized based on observations and will be used to explore the predictability of climate and to assess the forecast system's predictive skill. The CMIP5 experiment design also allows for participation of stand-alone atmospheric models and includes a variety of idealized experiments that will improve understanding of the range of model responses found in the more complex and realistic simulations. An exceptionally comprehensive set of model output is being collected and made freely available to researchers through an integrated but distributed data archive.

". Aerosol number distribution measurements are reported at San Pietro Capofiume (SPC) station (44°39' N, 11°37' E) for the time period 2002–2005. The station is located in Po Valley, the largest industrial, trading and agricultural area in Italy with a high population density. New particle formation was studied based on observations of the particle size distribution, meteorological and gas phase parameters. The nucleation events were classified according to the event clarity based on the particle number concentrations, and the particle formation and growth rates. Out of a total of 769 operational days from 2002 to 2005 clear events were detected on 36% of the days whilst 33% are clearly non-event days. The event frequency was high during spring and summer months with maximum values in May and July, whereas lower frequency was observed in winter and autumn months. The average particle formation and growth rates were estimated as ~6 cm−3 s−1 and ~7 nm h−1, respectively. Such high growth and formation rates are typical for polluted areas. Temperature, wind speed, solar radiation, SO2 and O3 concentrations were on average higher on nucleation days than on non-event days, whereas relative and absolute humidity and NO2 concentration were lower; however, seasonal differences were observed. Backtrajectory analysis suggests that during majority of nucleation event days, the air masses originate from northern to eastern directions. We also study previously developed nucleation event correlations with environmental variables and show that they predict Po Valley nucleation events with variable success.","['Ari Laaksonen', 'K. E.

"This paper describes a dynamic framework for an atmospheric general circulation spectral model in which a reference stratified atmospheric temperature and a reference surface pressure are introduced into the governing equations so as to improve the calculation of the pressure gradient force and gradients of surface pressure and temperature. The vertical profile of the reference atmospheric temperature approximately corresponds to that of the U.S. midlatitude standard atmosphere within the troposphere and stratosphere, and the reference surface pressure is a function of surface terrain geopotential and is close to the observed mean surface pressure. Prognostic variables for the temperature and surface pressure are replaced by their perturbations from the prescribed references. The numerical algorithms of the explicit time difference scheme for vorticity and the semi-implicit time difference scheme for divergence, perturbation temperature, and perturbation surface pressure equation are given in detail. The modified numerical framework is implemented in the Community Atmosphere Model version 3 (CAM3) developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) to test its validation and impact on simulated climate. Both the original and the modified models are run with the same spectral resolution (T42), the same physical parameterizations, and the same boundary conditions corresponding to the observed monthly mean sea surface temperature and sea ice concentration from 1971 to 2000. This permits one to evaluate the performance of the new dynamic framework compared to the commonly used one. Results show that there is a general improvement for the simulated climate at regional and global scales, especially for temperature and wind.","['Fang Zhang', 'Rucong Yu', 'Tongwen Wu']",10.1175/2007JAS2514.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2007jas2514.1,7,2008,A Modified Dynamic Framework for the Atmospheric Spectral Model and Its Application,['Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences'],"(['Atmospheric Science'],)",,Environmental Sciences

"The formulation and simulation characteristics of two new global coupled climate models developed at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) are described. The models were designed to simulate atmospheric and oceanic climate and variability from the diurnal time scale through multicentury climate change, given our computational constraints. In particular, an important goal was to use the same model for both experimental seasonal to interannual forecasting and the study of multicentury global climate change, and this goal has been achieved.               Two versions of the coupled model are described, called CM2.0 and CM2.1. The versions differ primarily in the dynamical core used in the atmospheric component, along with the cloud tuning and some details of the land and ocean components. For both coupled models, the resolution of the land and atmospheric components is 2° latitude × 2.5° longitude; the atmospheric model has 24 vertical levels. The ocean resolution is 1° in latitude and longitude, with meridional resolution equatorward of 30° becoming progressively finer, such that the meridional resolution is 1/3° at the equator. There are 50 vertical levels in the ocean, with 22 evenly spaced levels within the top 220 m. The ocean component has poles over North America and Eurasia to avoid polar filtering. Neither coupled model employs flux adjustments.               The control simulations have stable, realistic climates when integrated over multiple centuries. Both models have simulations of ENSO that are substantially improved relative to previous GFDL coupled models. The CM2.0 model has been further evaluated as an ENSO forecast model and has good skill (CM2.1 has not been evaluated as an ENSO forecast model). Generally reduced temperature and salinity biases exist in CM2.1 relative to CM2.0. These reductions are associated with 1) improved simulations of surface wind stress in CM2.1 and associated changes in oceanic gyre circulations; 2) changes in cloud tuning and the land model, both of which act to increase the net surface shortwave radiation in CM2.1, thereby reducing an overall cold bias present in CM2.0; and 3) a reduction of ocean lateral viscosity in the extratropics in CM2.1, which reduces sea ice biases in the North Atlantic.               Both models have been used to conduct a suite of climate change simulations for the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report and are able to simulate the main features of the observed warming of the twentieth century. The climate sensitivities of the CM2.0 and CM2.1 models are 2.9 and 3.4 K, respectively. These sensitivities are defined by coupling the atmospheric components of CM2.0 and CM2.1 to a slab ocean model and allowing the model to come into equilibrium with a doubling of atmospheric CO2. The output from a suite of integrations conducted with these models is freely available online (see http://nomads.gfdl.noaa.gov/).","['Rong Zhang', 'Fanrong Zeng', 'Bruce Wyman', 'Andrew T.

"The physical climate formulation and simulation characteristics of two new global coupled carbon–climate Earth System Models, ESM2M and ESM2G, are described. These models demonstrate similar climate fidelity as the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory’s previous Climate Model version 2.1 (CM2.1) while incorporating explicit and consistent carbon dynamics. The two models differ exclusively in the physical ocean component; ESM2M uses Modular Ocean Model version 4p1 with vertical pressure layers while ESM2G uses Generalized Ocean Layer Dynamics with a bulk mixed layer and interior isopycnal layers. Differences in the ocean mean state include the thermocline depth being relatively deep in ESM2M and relatively shallow in ESM2G compared to observations. The crucial role of ocean dynamics on climate variability is highlighted in El Niño–Southern Oscillation being overly strong in ESM2M and overly weak in ESM2G relative to observations. Thus, while ESM2G might better represent climate changes relating to total heat content variability given its lack of long-term drift, gyre circulation, and ventilation in the North Pacific, tropical Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, and depth structure in the overturning and abyssal flows, ESM2M might better represent climate changes relating to surface circulation given its superior surface temperature, salinity, and height patterns, tropical Pacific circulation and variability, and Southern Ocean dynamics. The overall assessment is that neither model is fundamentally superior to the other, and that both models achieve sufficient fidelity to allow meaningful climate and earth system modeling applications. This affords the ability to assess the role of ocean configuration on earth system interactions in the context of two state-of-the-art coupled carbon–climate models.","['Niki Zadeh', 'Andrew T.

". We describe here the development and evaluation of an Earth system model suitable for centennial-scale climate prediction. The principal new components added to the physical climate model are the terrestrial and ocean ecosystems and gas-phase tropospheric chemistry, along with their coupled interactions.  The individual Earth system components are described briefly and the relevant interactions between the components are explained. Because the multiple interactions could lead to unstable feedbacks, we go through a careful process of model spin up to ensure that all components are stable and the interactions balanced. This spun-up configuration is evaluated against observed data for the Earth system components and is generally found to perform very satisfactorily. The reason for the evaluation phase is that the model is to be used for the core climate simulations carried out by the Met Office Hadley Centre for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), so it is essential that addition of the extra complexity does not detract substantially from its climate performance. Localised changes in some specific meteorological variables can be identified, but the impacts on the overall simulation of present day climate are slight.  This model is proving valuable both for climate predictions, and for investigating the strengths of biogeochemical feedbacks.","['S. Woodward', 'A. Wiltshire', 'I. Totterdell', 'S. Sitch', 'C.

The NorESM family of models are based on the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4) of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, but differs from the latter by, in particular, an isopycnic coordinate ocean model and advanced chemistry–aerosol–cloud–radiation interaction schemes. NorESM1-M has a horizontal resolution of approximately 2° for the atmosphere and land components and 1° for the ocean and ice components. NorESM is also available in a lower resolution version (NorESM1-L) and a version that includes prognostic biogeochemical cycling (NorESM1-ME). The latter two model configurations are not part of this paper. Here, a first-order assessment of the model stability, the mean model state and the internal variability based on the model experiments made available to CMIP5 are presented.

". The recently developed Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM) is employed for simulations contributing to the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5) experiments and the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-AR5). In this manuscript, we focus on evaluating the ocean and land carbon cycle components of the NorESM, based on the control and historical simulations. Many of the observed large scale ocean biogeochemical features are reproduced satisfactorily by the NorESM. When compared to the climatological estimates from the World Ocean Atlas (WOA), the model simulated temperature, salinity, oxygen, and phosphate distributions agree reasonably well in both the surface layer and deep water structure. However, the model simulates a relatively strong overturning circulation strength that leads to noticeable model-data bias, especially within the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). This strong overturning circulation slightly distorts the structure of the biogeochemical tracers at depth. Advancements in simulating the oceanic mixed layer depth with respect to the previous generation model particularly improve the surface tracer distribution as well as the upper ocean biogeochemical processes, particularly in the Southern Ocean. Consequently, near surface ocean processes such as biological production and air-sea gas exchange, are in good agreement with climatological observations. NorESM reproduces the general pattern of land-vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP) when compared to the observationally-based values derived from the FLUXNET network of eddy covariance towers. Globally, the NorESM simulated annual mean GPP and terrestrial respiration are 129.8 and 106.6 Pg C yr−1, slightly larger than observed of 119.4 ± 5.9 and 96.4 ± 6.0 Pg C yr−1. The latitudinal distribution of GPP fluxes simulated by NorESM shows a GPP overestimation of 10% in the tropics and a substantial underestimation of GPP at high latitudes.","['C. Heinze', 'Ø.

"This study investigates the distribution of cadmium and lead concentrations in the outcrop rock samples collected from Abakaliki anticlinorium in the Southern Benue Trough, Nigeria. The outcrop rock samples from seven sampling locations were air–dried for seventy–two hours, homogenized by grinding and pass through < 63 micron mesh sieve. The ground and homogenized rock samples were pulverized and analyzed for cadmium and lead using X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometer. The concentrations of heavy metals in the outcrop rock samples ranged from < 0.10 – 7.95 mg kg–1 for cadmium (Cd) and < 1.00 – 4966.00 mg kg–1 for lead (Pb). Apart from an anomalous concentration measured in Afikpo Shale (Middle Segment), the results obtained revealed that rock samples from all the sampling locations yielded cadmium concentrations of < 0.10 mg kg–1 and the measured concentrations were below the average crustal abundance of 0.50 mg kg–1. Although background concentration of <1.00 ± 0.02 mg kg–1 was measured in Abakaliki Shale, rock samples from all the sampling locations revealed anomalous lead concentrations above average crustal abundance of 30 mg kg–1. The results obtained reveal important contributions towards understanding of heavy metal distribution patterns and provide baseline data that can be used for potential identification of areas at risk associated with natural sources of heavy metals contamination in the region. The use of outcrop rocks provides a cost–effective approach for monitoring regional heavy metal contamination associated with dissolution and/or weathering of rocks or parent materials. Evaluation of heavy metals may be effectively used in large scale regional pollution monitoring of soil, groundwater, atmospheric and marine environment. Therefore, monitoring of heavy metal concentrations in soils, groundwater and atmospheric environment is imperative in order to prevent bioaccumulation in various ecological receptors.","['Nsi, Edet W.', 'Bassey, Clement E.', 'Harry, Thomas A.', 'Aniefiok Ite', 'Etesin, Usoro M.']",10.12691/JEPHH-3-3-2,http://pubs.sciepub.com/jephh/3/3/2,1,2015,"Assessment of Cadmium and Lead Distribution in the Outcrop Rocks of Abakaliki Anticlinorium in the Southern Benue Trough, Nigeria",Journal of Environment Pollution and Human Health,,['Geology'],Environmental Sciences
"Nowadays, the increasing demand of water for electricity production, agricultural and industrial uses are directly affecting the reduction of available quality water for human consumption in the world. Efficient and sustainable maintenance of water reservoirs and supply networks implies a holistic strategy that takes into account, as much as possible, information from the stages of water usage. Next,-generation decision-making software tools, for supporting water management, require the integration of multiple and heterogeneous data sources of different knowledge domains. In this regard, Linked Data and Semantic Web technologies enable harmonization of different data sources, as well as the efficient querying for feeding upper-level Business Intelligence processes. This work investigates the design, implementation and usage of a semantic approach driven by ontology to capture, store, integrate and exploit real-world data concerning water supply networks management. As a main contribution, the proposal helps with obtaining semantically enriched linked data, enhancing the analysis of water network performance. For validation purposes, in the use case, a series of data sources from different measures have been considered, in the scope of an actual water management system of the Mediterranean region of Valencia (Spain), throughout several years of activity. The obtained experience shows the benefits of using the proposed approach to identify possible correlations between the measures such as the supplied water, the water leaks or the population.","['Jesús Peral', 'María del Mar Roldán-García', 'Pilar Escobar']",10.3390/app10030779,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/3/779,0,2020,An Ontology-Based Framework for Publishing and Exploiting Linked Open Data: A Use Case on Water Resources Management,MDPI,"(['Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes', 'Computer Science Applications', 'Process Chemistry and Technology', 'General Engineering', 'Instrumentation', 'General Materials Science'],)",,Environmental Sciences
"The increasing deterioration of aquatic environments has attracted more attention to water quality monitoring techniques, with most researchers focusing on the acquisition and assessment of water quality data, but seldom on the discovery and tracing of pollution sources. In this study, a semantic-enhanced modeling method for ontology modeling and rules building is proposed, which can be used for river water quality monitoring and relevant data observation processing. The observational process ontology (OPO) method can describe the semantic properties of water resources and observation data. In addition, it can provide the semantic relevance among the different concepts involved in the observational process of water quality monitoring. A pollution alert can be achieved using the reasoning rules for the water quality monitoring stations. In this study, a case is made for the usability testing of the OPO models and reasoning rules by utilizing a water quality monitoring system. The system contributes to the water quality observational monitoring process and traces the source of pollutants using sensors, observation data, process models, and observation products that users can access in a timely manner.","['Zhihui Tian', 'Xiaohui He ', 'Nengcheng Chen', 'Haitao Wei ', 'Xiaolei Wang ']",10.3390/w12030715,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/12/3/715,0,2020,An Observational Process Ontology-Based Modeling Approach for Water Quality Monitoring,MDPI,"(['Water Science and Technology', 'Aquatic Science', 'Geography, Planning and Development', 'Biochemistry'],)",,Environmental Sciences

"The effect crude oil pollution and amendment treatments using decomposed green manure (Calopogonium muconoides Desvaux and Aspilia africana (Person) C.D.Adams) on the growth and neutraceutical (minerals, proximate and vitamins A and C) of Cucurbita maxima were studied. Crude oil polluted soils were obtained by mixing thoroughly 10 kg of sandy-loam soil with 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 ml of crude oil, 0 ml served as control. The amendment treatment with green manure of C. muconoides and A. africana was carried out by adding the different levels of crude oil polluted soils (10 – 50 ml) with 4 kg of the compost manure. The experimental work was carried out in the green house using plastic buckets. Measurement of selected growth parameters such as percentage germination, vine length, leaf area, internode length, leaf number and petiole length was carried out after nine weeks. The results indicated that crude oil pollution significantly (p=0.05) reduced the growth parameters of C. maxima. Mineral content, proximate composition and vitamin A and C contents of C. maxima also showed pronounced reduction with increase in crude oil concentration. The addition of amendment treatment with green manure of C. muconoides and A. africana to ameliorate the impeding condition in the crude oil polluted soil significantly (p=0.05) improved the growth parameters and neutraceutical composition of C. maxima when compared to the pollution treatment. This study revealed that crude oil pollution negatively affected the growth and neutraceutical composition and generally the productivity of C. maxima. From this study, it is evident that C. muconoides and A. africana enhanced the growth and quality of C. maxima. Therefore, C. muconoides and A. africana should be used for effective and efficient bioremediation practices.","O. G. Okon, J. E. Okon and G. D. O.

"This study evaluated the influence of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal (Rhizophagus irregularis) fungi inoculation (M) on the growth of Cucurbita maxima and as a buffer against phytoextraction of selected heavy metals (HM) (Zn, Cu, Cr, Cd and Pb) from a soil polluted with crude oil (C). The experiment was set up using four soil treatments, in triplicates C+ M-, C+ M+, CM+ and CM(control without crude oil and inoculum). The shoot length, petiole length, number of nodes, leaf area and percentage germination of C. maxima were significantly (p=0.05) reduced in uninoculated crude oil treatment (C+ M-), unpolluted mycorrhizal inoculated treatments (CM+) showed remarkable response in growth parameters above the control (CM-), while the polluted and inoculated treatment (C+ M+) showed significant (p=0.05) increase in growth parameters when compared to the polluted uninoculated treatment (C+ M-). Heavy metals analysis revealed a significant (p=0.05) difference in the heavy metal accumulation of C. maxima. The heavy metals analyzed in this study are present thus in C. maxima; Zn>Cu>Cr>Pb>Cd. Crude oil polluted uninoculated treatment (C+ M-) recorded the highest concentrations of heavy metals than crude oil polluted inoculated (R. irregularis) treatment (C+ M+). Mycorrhizal inoculated unpolluted treatment (CM+) and unpolluted uninoculated treatment (CM-) indicated the lowest heavy metal concentrations. Inoculation with R. irregularis significantly (p=0.05) reduced heavy metals uptake by C. maxima as observed in this study. Also, the downbeat effect of crude oil on AM Fungi root colonization of C. maxima by R. irregularis was observed in polluted and inoculated treatment. HM often accumulate in the top soil, therefore, are available for uptake by plants via roots, which is a major entry point of HM that ultimately affects different physiological processes. AM fungi can impinge on the chemical properties of heavy metals in the soil, their absorption by the host plant, and their allocation to different plant parts, affecting plant growth and the bioremediation process, thus making the AM fungi a suitable buffer for mitigating heavy metal stress on C. maxima.","O.

"Textural characterization and heavy mineral studies of beach sediments in Ibeno and Eastern Obolo Local Government Areas of Akwa Ibom State were carried out in the present study. The main aim was to infer their provenance, transport history and environment of deposition. Sediment samples were collected at the water–sediment contact along the shoreline at an interval of about 3m. Ten samples were collected from study location 1 (Ibeno Beach) and twelve samples were collected from study location 2 (Eastern Obolo Beach). A total of twenty–two samples were collected from the field and brought to the laboratory for textural and compositional analyses. The results showed that the value of graphic mean size ranged from 1.70Ф to 2.83Ф, sorting values ranged from 0.39Ф – 0.60Ф, skewness values ranged from -0.02 to 0.10 while kurtosis values ranged from 1.02 to 2.46, indicating medium to fine grained and well sorted sediments. This suggested that the sediments have been transported far from their source. Longshore current and onshore–offshore movements of sediment are primarily responsible in sorting of the heavy minerals. The histogram charts for the different samples and standard deviation versus skewness indicated a beach environment of deposition. This implies that the sediments are dominated by one class of grain size; a phenomenon characteristic of beach environments. The heavy mineral assemblages identified in this research work were rutile, zircon, tourmaline, hornblende, apatite, diopside, glauconite, pumpellyite, cassiterite, epidote, garnet, augite, enstatite, andalusite and opaque minerals. The zircon-tourmaline-rutile (ZTR) index ranged from 47.30% to 87.00% with most of the samples showing a ZTR index greater than 50%. These indicated that the sediments were mineralogically sub-mature and have been transported far from their source. The heavy minerals identified are indicative of being products of reworked sediments of both metamorphic (high rank) and igneous (both mafic and sialic) origin probably derived from the basement rocks of the Oban Massif as well as reworked sediments of the Benue Trough. Therefore, findings from the present study indicated that erosion, accretion, and stability of beaches are controlled by strong hydrodynamic and hydraulic processes.","['Aidoko, Emmanuella E.', 'Asuaiko, Ekpedeme R.', 'Aniefiok Ite', 'Bassey, Clement E.']",10.12691/jgg-7-4-4,http://pubs.sciepub.com/jgg/7/4/4,8,2019,Textural and Heavy Minerals Characterization of Coastal Sediments in Ibeno and Eastern Obolo Local Government Areas of Akwa Ibom State – Nigeria,Journal of Geosciences and Geomatics,,['Geology'],Geology

"Airborne hyperspectral data have been available to researchers since the early 1980s and their use for geologic applications is well documented. The launch of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Earth Observing 1 Hyperion sensor in November 2000 marked the establishment of a test bed for spaceborne hyperspectral capabilities. Hyperion covers the 0.4-2.5-/spl mu/m range with 242 spectral bands at approximately 10-nm spectral resolution and 30-m spatial resolution. Analytical Imaging and Geophysics LLC and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation have been involved in efforts to evaluate, validate, and demonstrate Hyperions's utility for geologic mapping in a variety of sites in the United States and around the world. Initial results over several sites with established ground truth and years of airborne hyperspectral data show that Hyperion data from the shortwave infrared spectrometer can be used to produce useful geologic (mineralogic) information. Minerals mapped include carbonates, chlorite, epidote, kaolinite, alunite, buddingtonite, muscovite, hydrothermal silica, and zeolite. Hyperion data collected under optimum conditions (summer season, bright targets, well-exposed geology) indicate that Hyperion data meet prelaunch specifications and allow subtle distinctions such as determining the difference between calcite and dolomite and mapping solid solution differences in micas caused by substitution in octahedral molecular sites. Comparison of airborne hyperspectral data [from the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS)] to the Hyperion data establishes that Hyperion provides similar basic mineralogic information, with the principal limitation being limited mapping of fine spectral detail under less-than-optimum acquisition conditions (winter season, dark targets) based on lower signal-to-noise ratios. Case histories demonstrate the analysis methodologies and level of information available from the Hyperion data. They also show the viability of Hyperion as a means of extending hyperspectral mineral mapping to areas not accessible to aircraft sensors. The analysis results demonstrate that spaceborne hyperspectral sensors can produce useful mineralogic information, but also indicate that SNR improvements are required for future spaceborne sensors to allow the same level of mapping that is currently possible from airborne sensors such as AVIRIS.","[' Jonathan F.

"Total organic carbon (TOC) is the amount of carbon present in an organic compound and is often used as an essential factor for unconventional shale resources evaluation. The previous models for TOC determination were either based on density log data only and considered the presence of organic matter is proportional to the bulk density, or based on resistivity log, sonic or density logs as well as the formation level of maturity (LOM), where these models assumed a linear relation between resistivity and porosity logs. The average absolute deviation (ADD) of the previous model was not less than 1.20wt% of TOC with a coefficient of determination (R2) of less than 0.85.               The objective of this research is to develop new empirical correlation to determine the TOC based on well logs using artificial neural network for Barnett shale formation. Core TOC data (442 data point) and well logs (resistivity, gamma ray, sonic transit time, and bulk density) were used to develop the ANN model. For the first time, the ANN model will change to a white box by extracting the weights and biases of the model to form the empirical equation.               The results obtained showed that TOC is strong function of bulk density, and moderate function of gamma ray, compressional sonic time, and week function of deep resistivity. The developed ANN model is able to predict the TOC based on conventional log data with high accuracy (the ADD is 0.91wt% of TOC and R2 between estimated and actual TOC is 0.93). The developed empirical equation for TOC determination from the ANN model outperformed the previous available models, which had an ADD of 1.20 wt% or more and R2 of less than 0.85. The developed TOC model and equation can be applied using simple computer without the need for a specific software.               The novelty of this new research is the simplicity and high accuracy of the developed model for estimating the total organic carbon based on conventional log data. The developed empirical equation will help the geologists and reservoir engineers to predict the TOC without the need for hard lab work or complicated softwares.","['Abdulwahab Ali', 'Mohamed Omar Ibrahim', 'Mohamed Mahmoud', 'Abdulazeez Abdulraheem', 'Salaheldin ElKatatny', 'Ahmed Abdulhamid Mahmoud']",10.2118/188016-ms,https://doi.org/10.2118/188016-MS,0,2017,New Technique to Determine the Total Organic Carbon Based on Well Logs Using Artificial Neural Network (White Box),"['Day 3 Wed, April 26, 2017']","([],)",,Geophysics and Seismology

"Catch crops increase plant species richness in crop rotations, but are most often grown as pure stands. Here, we investigate the impacts of increasing plant diversity in catch crop rotations on rhizosphere C input and microbial utilization. Mustard (Sinapis alba L.) planted as a single cultivar was compared to diversified catch crop mixtures of four (Mix4) or 12 species (Mix12). We traced the C transfer from shoots to roots towards the soil microbial community and the soil respiration in a 13C pulse labelling field experiment. Net CO2-C uptake from the atmosphere increased by two times in mix 4 and more than three times in mix 12. Higher net ecosystem C production was linked to increasing catch crop diversity and increased belowground transfer rates of recently fixed photoassimilates. The higher rhizosphere C input stimulated the growth and activity of the soil microbiome, which was investigated by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analyses. Total microbial biomass increased from 14 to 22 g m−2 as compared to the fallow and was 18 and 8% higher for mix 12 and mix 4 as compared to mustard. In particular, the fungal and actinobacterial communities profited the most from the higher belowground C input and their biomass increased by 3.4 and 1.3 times as compared to the fallow. The residence time of the 13C pulse, traced in the CO2 flux from the soil environment, increased with plant diversity by up to 1.8 times. The results of this study suggest positive impacts of plant diversity on C cycling by higher atmospheric C uptake, higher transport rates towards the rhizosphere, higher microbial incorporation and prolonged residence time in the soil environment. We conclude that diversified catch crop mixtures improve the efficiency of C cycling in cropping systems and provide a promising tool for sustainable soil management.","['Georg Guggenberger', 'Fabricio Camacho Céspedes', 'Thomas Hurek', 'Barbara Reinhold-Hurek', 'Bernhard Bauer', 'Jonas Groß', 'Ulf Feuerstein', 'Dörte Schweneker', 'Nicolaus von Wirén', 'Diana Heuermann', 'Juan Daniel Kennedy Batalla', ' Jens Boy', 'Norman Gentsch']",10.1007/s00374-020-01475-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-020-01475-8,0,2020,Catch crop diversity increases rhizosphere carbon input and soil microbial biomass,Biology and Fertility of Soils,"(['Soil Science', 'Agronomy and Crop Science', 'Microbiology'],)",,Soil Science

". The Baltic Sea Region is very sensitive to climate change; it is a region with spatially varying climate and diverse ecosystems, but also under pressure due to high population in large parts of the area. Climate change impacts could easily exacerbate other anthropogenic stressors such as biodiversity stress from society and eutrophication of the Baltic Sea considerably. Therefore, there has been a focus on estimations of future climate change and its impacts in recent research. In this review paper, we will concentrate on a presentation of recent climate projections from both atmosphere-only and coupled atmosphere-ocean regional climate models. The recent regional climate model projections strengthen the picture from previous assessments. This includes a strong warming, in particular in the north in winter. Precipitation is projected to increase in the whole region apart from the southern half during summer. Consequently, the new results lend more credibility to estimates of uncertainties and robust features of future climate change. Furthermore, the larger number of scenarios gives opportunities to better address impacts of mitigation measures. The coupled atmosphere-ocean model locally modifies the climate change signal relative to that in the stand-alone atmosphere regional climate model. Differences are largest in areas where the coupled system arrives at different sea-surface temperatures and sea-ice conditions.","['H. E.

"The aim for a more accurate representation of tropical convection in global circulation models is a long-standing issue. Here, the relationships between large and convective scales in observations and a stochastic multicloud model (SMCM) to ultimately support the design of a novel convection parameterization with stochastic elements are investigated. Observations of tropical convection obtained at Darwin and Kwajalein are used here. It is found that the variability of observed tropical convection generally decreases with increasing large-scale forcing, implying a transition from stochastic to more deterministic behavior with increasing forcing. Convection shows a more systematic relationship with measures related to large-scale convergence compared to measures related to energetics (e.g., CAPE). Using the observations, the parameters in the SMCM are adjusted. Then, the SMCM is forced with the time series of the observed large-scale state and the simulated convective behavior is compared to that observed. It is found that the SMCM cloud fields compare better with observations when using predictors related to convergence rather than energetics. Furthermore, the underlying framework of the SMCM is able to reproduce the observed functional dependencies of convective variability on the imposed large-scale state—an encouraging result on the road toward a novel convection parameterization approach. However, establishing sound cause-and-effect relationships between tropical convection and the large-scale environment remains problematic and warrants further research.","['Andrew J.

". Climate sensitivity to CO2 remains the key uncertainty in projections of future climate change. Transient climate response (TCR) is the metric of temperature sensitivity that is most relevant to warming in the next few decades and contributes the biggest uncertainty to estimates of the carbon budgets consistent with the Paris targets. Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is vital for understanding longer-term climate change and stabilisation targets. In the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5), the stated “likely” ranges (16 %–84 % confidence) of TCR (1.0–2.5 K) and ECS (1.5–4.5 K) were broadly consistent with the ensemble of CMIP5 Earth system models (ESMs) available at the time. However, many of the latest CMIP6 ESMs have larger climate sensitivities, with 5 of 34 models having TCR values above 2.5 K and an ensemble mean TCR of 2.0±0.4 K. Even starker, 12 of 34 models have an ECS value above 4.5 K. On the face of it, these latest ESM results suggest that the IPCC likely ranges may need revising upwards, which would cast further doubt on the feasibility of the Paris targets. Here we show that rather than increasing the uncertainty in climate sensitivity, the CMIP6 models help to constrain the likely range of TCR to 1.3–2.1 K, with a central estimate of 1.68 K. We reach this conclusion through an emergent constraint approach which relates the value of TCR linearly to the global warming from 1975 onwards. This is a period when the signal-to-noise ratio of the net radiative forcing increases strongly, so that uncertainties in aerosol forcing become progressively less problematic. We find a consistent emergent constraint on TCR when we apply the same method to CMIP5 models. Our constraints on TCR are in good agreement with other recent studies which analysed CMIP ensembles. The relationship between ECS and the post-1975 warming trend is less direct and also non-linear. However, we are able to derive a likely range of ECS of 1.9–3.4 K from the CMIP6 models by assuming an underlying emergent relationship based on a two-box energy balance model. Despite some methodological differences; this is consistent with a previously published ECS constraint derived from warming trends in CMIP5 models to 2005. Our results seem to be part of a growing consensus amongst studies that have applied the emergent constraint approach to different model ensembles and to different aspects of the record of global warming.","['Mark S.

"Future global warming estimates have been similar across past assessments, but several climate models of the latest Sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) simulate much stronger warming, apparently inconsistent with past assessments. Here, we show that projected future warming is correlated with the simulated warming trend during recent decades across CMIP5 and CMIP6 models, enabling us to constrain future warming based on consistency with the observed warming. These findings carry important policy-relevant implications: The observationally constrained CMIP6 median warming in high emissions and ambitious mitigation scenarios is over 16 and 14% lower by 2050 compared to the raw CMIP6 median, respectively, and over 14 and 8% lower by 2090, relative to 1995–2014. Observationally constrained CMIP6 warming is consistent with previous assessments based on CMIP5 models, and in an ambitious mitigation scenario, the likely range is consistent with reaching the Paris Agreement target.","['Reto Knutti', 'Flavio Lehner', 'Christopher J.

"The effectiveness of stringent climate stabilization scenarios for coastal areas in terms of reduction of impacts/adaptation needs and wider policy implications has received little attention. Here we use the Warming Acidification and Sea Level Projector Earth systems model to calculate large ensembles of global sea-level rise (SLR) and ocean pH projections to 2300 for 1.5°C and 2.0°C stabilization scenarios, and a reference unmitigated RCP8.5 scenario. The potential consequences of these projections are then considered for global coastal flooding, small islands, deltas, coastal cities and coastal ecology. Under both stabilization scenarios, global mean ocean pH (and temperature) stabilize within a century. This implies significant ecosystem impacts are avoided, but detailed quantification is lacking, reflecting scientific uncertainty. By contrast, SLR is only slowed and continues to 2300 (and beyond). Hence, while coastal impacts due to SLR are reduced significantly by climate stabilization, especially after 2100, potential impacts continue to grow for centuries. SLR in 2300 under both stabilization scenarios exceeds unmitigated SLR in 2100. Therefore, adaptation remains essential in densely populated and economically important coastal areas under climate stabilization. Given the multiple adaptation steps that this will require, an adaptation pathways approach has merits for coastal areas.

". The Paris Agreement of December 2015 stated a goal to pursue efforts to keep global temperatures below 1.5 °C above preindustrial levels and well below 2 °C. The IPCC was charged with assessing climate impacts at these temperature levels, but fully coupled equilibrium climate simulations do not currently exist to inform such assessments. In this study, we produce a set of scenarios using a simple model designed to achieve long-term 1.5 and 2 °C temperatures in a stable climate. These scenarios are then used to produce century-scale ensemble simulations using the Community Earth System Model, providing impact-relevant long-term climate data for stabilization pathways at 1.5 and 2 °C levels and an overshoot 1.5 °C case, which are realized (for the 21st century) in the coupled model and are freely available to the community. Here we describe the design of the simulations and a brief overview of their impact-relevant climate response. Exceedance of historical record temperature occurs with 60 % greater frequency in the 2 °C climate than in a 1.5 °C climate aggregated globally, and with twice the frequency in equatorial and arid regions. Extreme precipitation intensity is statistically significantly higher in a 2.0 °C climate than a 1.5 °C climate in some specific regions (but not all). The model exhibits large differences in the Arctic, which is ice-free with a frequency of 1 in 3 years in the 2.0 °C scenario, and 1 in 40 years in the 1.5 °C scenario. Significance of impact differences with respect to multi-model variability is not assessed.","['Jean Francois Lamarque', 'Reto Knutti', 'Lei Lin', 'Warren G. Strand', 'Flavio Lehner', 'Angeline G.

". Robust appraisals of climate impacts at different levels of global-mean temperature increase are vital to guide assessments of dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. The 2015 Paris Agreement includes a two-headed temperature goal: ""holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C"". Despite the prominence of these two temperature limits, a comprehensive overview of the differences in climate impacts at these levels is still missing. Here we provide an assessment of key impacts of climate change at warming levels of 1.5 °C and 2 °C, including extreme weather events, water availability, agricultural yields, sea-level rise and risk of coral reef loss. Our results reveal substantial differences in impacts between a 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming that are highly relevant for the assessment of dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. For heat-related extremes, the additional 0.5 °C increase in global-mean temperature marks the difference between events at the upper limit of present-day natural variability and a new climate regime, particularly in tropical regions. Similarly, this warming difference is likely to be decisive for the future of tropical coral reefs. In a scenario with an end-of-century warming of 2 °C, virtually all tropical coral reefs are projected to be at risk of severe degradation due to temperature-induced bleaching from 2050 onwards. This fraction is reduced to about 90 % in 2050 and projected to decline to 70 % by 2100 for a 1.5 °C scenario. Analyses of precipitation-related impacts reveal distinct regional differences and hot-spots of change emerge. Regional reduction in median water availability for the Mediterranean is found to nearly double from 9 % to 17 % between 1.5 °C and 2 °C, and the projected lengthening of regional dry spells increases from 7 to 11 %. Projections for agricultural yields differ between crop types as well as world regions. While some (in particular high-latitude) regions may benefit, tropical regions like West Africa, South-East Asia, as well as Central and northern South America are projected to face substantial local yield reductions, particularly for wheat and maize. Best estimate sea-level rise projections based on two illustrative scenarios indicate a 50 cm rise by 2100 relative to year 2000-levels for a 2 °C scenario, and about 10 cm lower levels for a 1.5 °C scenario. In a 1.5 °C scenario, the rate of sea-level rise in 2100 would be reduced by about 30 % compared to a 2 °C scenario. Our findings highlight the importance of regional differentiation to assess both future climate risks and different vulnerabilities to incremental increases in global-mean temperature. The article provides a consistent and comprehensive assessment of existing projections and a good basis for future work on refining our understanding of the difference between impacts at 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming.","['Michiel Schaeffer', 'William Hare', 'Matthias Mengel', 'Katja Frieler', 'Jacob Schewe', 'Katelin Childers', 'Joeri Rogelj', 'Antonius Golly', 'Mahé Perrette', 'Jan Wohland', 'Erich M.

"Sea level has been steadily rising over the past century, predominantly due to anthropogenic climate change. The rate of sea level rise will keep increasing with continued global warming, and, even if temperatures are stabilized through the phasing out of greenhouse gas emissions, sea level is still expected to rise for centuries. This will affect coastal areas worldwide, and robust projections are needed to assess mitigation options and guide adaptation measures. Here we combine the equilibrium response of the main sea level rise contributions with their last century's observed contribution to constrain projections of future sea level rise. Our model is calibrated to a set of observations for each contribution, and the observational and climate uncertainties are combined to produce uncertainty ranges for 21st century sea level rise. We project anthropogenic sea level rise of 28–56 cm, 37–77 cm, and 57–131 cm in 2100 for the greenhouse gas concentration scenarios RCP26, RCP45, and RCP85, respectively. Our uncertainty ranges for total sea level rise overlap with the process-based estimates of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The “constrained extrapolation” approach generalizes earlier global semiempirical models and may therefore lead to a better understanding of the discrepancies with process-based projections.","['Ricarda Winkelmann', 'Ben Marzeion', 'Alexander Robinson', 'Katja Frieler', 'Anders Levermann', 'Matthias Mengel']",10.1073/pnas.1500515113,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1500515113,2,2016,Future sea level rise constrained by observations and long-term commitment,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,"(['Multidisciplinary'],)",,Climate

". Climate change causes global mean sea level to rise due to thermal expansion of seawater and loss of land ice from mountain glaciers, ice caps and ice sheets. Locally, sea level can strongly deviate from the global mean rise due to changes in wind and ocean currents. In addition, gravitational adjustments redistribute seawater away from shrinking ice masses. However, the land ice contribution to sea level rise (SLR) remains very challenging to model, and comprehensive regional sea level projections, which include appropriate gravitational adjustments, are still a nascent field (Katsman et al., 2011; Slangen et al., 2011). Here, we present an alternative approach to derive regional sea level changes for a range of emission and land ice melt scenarios, combining probabilistic forecasts of a simple climate model (MAGICC6) with the new CMIP5 general circulation models.  The contribution from ice sheets varies considerably depending on the assumptions for the ice sheet projections, and thus represents sizeable uncertainties for future sea level rise. However, several consistent and robust patterns emerge from our analysis: at low latitudes, especially in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific, sea level will likely rise more than the global mean (mostly by 10–20%). Around the northeastern Atlantic and the northeastern Pacific coasts, sea level will rise less than the global average or, in some rare cases, even fall. In the northwestern Atlantic, along the American coast, a strong dynamic sea level rise is counteracted by gravitational depression due to Greenland ice melt; whether sea level will be above- or below-average will depend on the relative contribution of these two factors. Our regional sea level projections and the diagnosed uncertainties provide an improved basis for coastal impact analysis and infrastructure planning for adaptation to climate change.","['M.

"The use of water resources has increased with rapid population growth, industrial development, and agricultural activities. Besides, the problem might increase with the potential climate change impacts on water quantity. Thus, sustainable use of water resources becomes crucial. Modeling studies provide scientific support to the analysis of water resource problems and develop strategies for current and potential problems for the sustainable management of water resources. In this study, WEAP-PGM (Water Evaluation and Planning System—Plant Growth Model) was applied to the Sakarya River Basin in Turkey, where almost 50% of the area is agricultural land. The main goals in the study are compiling/integrating available data from different sources in a data-scarce region for hydrological models, and estimating the water budget components of Sakarya River Basin on an annual basis as well as investigating the applicability of WEAP-PGM. General model performance ratings indicated that model simulations represent streamflow variations at acceptable levels. Model results revealed that, runoff is 4747 million m3, flow to groundwater is 3065 million m3 and evapotranspiration is 23,011 million m3.

The resulting electrochemical biosensor was validated towards glucose oxidation in real samples and further electrochemical measurement associated with the generated H2O2. The electrochemical biosensor showed an excellent sensitivity (42.7 μA mM−1 cm−2), limit of detection (7.6 μM), linear range (20 μM–2.3 mM), and good selectivity towards glucose determination. Furthermore, and most importantly, the detection of glucose was performed at a low potential (0.2 V vs. Ag). The high performance of the electrochemical biosensor was explained through surface exploration using field emission SEM, XPS, and impedance measurements. The electrochemical biosensor was successfully applied to glucose quantification in several real samples (commercial juices and a plant cell culture medium), exhibiting a high accuracy when compared with a classical spectrophotometric method. This electrochemical biosensor can be easily prepared and opens up a good alternative in the development of new sensitive glucose sensors.","['Edelmira Valero', 'Jesús Iniesta', 'Rebeca Jiménez-Pérez', 'María Isabel González-Sánchez', 'Francisco Jiménez-Fiérrez']",10.3390/s20164489,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s20164489,8,2020,Glucose Biosensor Based on Disposable Activated Carbon Electrodes Modified with Platinum Nanoparticles Electrodeposited on Poly(Azure A),Sensors,"(['Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Biochemistry', 'Instrumentation', 'Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics', 'Analytical Chemistry'],)",,Engineering

"In recent times, polymer-based flexible pressure sensors have been attracting a lot of attention because of their various applications. A highly sensitive and flexible sensor is suggested, capable of being attached to the human body, based on a three-dimensional dielectric elastomeric structure of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and microsphere composite. This sensor has maximal porosity due to macropores created by sacrificial layer grains and micropores generated by microspheres pre-mixed with PDMS, allowing it to operate at a wider pressure range (~150 kPa) while maintaining a sensitivity (of 0.124 kPa−1 in a range of 0~15 kPa) better than in previous studies. The maximized pores can cause deformation in the structure, allowing for the detection of small changes in pressure. In addition to exhibiting a fast rise time (~167 ms) and fall time (~117 ms), as well as excellent reproducibility, the fabricated pressure sensor exhibits reliability in its response to repeated mechanical stimuli (2.5 kPa, 1000 cycles). As an application, we develop a wearable device for monitoring repeated tiny motions, such as the pulse on the human neck and swallowing at the Adam’s apple. This sensory device is also used to detect movements in the index finger and to monitor an insole system in real-time.","['Hanchul Cho', 'Jongsoo Ko', 'Jinhyoung Park', 'Byunggeon Park', 'Kyungkuk Jung', 'Wookjin Lee', 'Young Jung']",10.3390/polym12061412,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/polym12061412,6,2020,A Highly Sensitive and Flexible Capacitive Pressure Sensor Based on a Porous Three-Dimensional PDMS/Microsphere Composite,Polymers,"(['Polymers and Plastics', 'General Chemistry'],)",,Engineering

"Introduction                The first wave of COVID-19 pandemic period has drastically changed people’s lives all over the world. To cope with the disruption, digital solutions have become more popular. However, the ability to adopt digitalised alternatives is different across socio-economic and socio-demographic groups.                              Objective                This study investigates how individuals have changed their activity-travel patterns and internet usage during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic period, and which of these changes may be kept.                              Methods                An empirical data collection was deployed through online forms. 781 responses from different countries (Italy, Sweden, India and others) have been collected, and a series of multivariate analyses was carried out. Two linear regression models are presented, related to the change of travel activities and internet usage, before and during the pandemic period. Furthermore, a binary regression model is used to examine the likelihood of the respondents to adopt and keep their behaviours beyond the pandemic period.                              Results                The results show that the possibility to change the behaviour matter. External restrictions and personal characteristics are the driving factors of the reduction in ones' daily trips. However, the estimation results do not show a strong correlation between the countries' restriction policy and the respondents' likelihood to adopt the new and online-based behaviours for any of the activities after the restriction period.                              Conclusion                The acceptance and long-term adoption of the online alternatives for activities are correlated with the respondents' personality and socio-demographic group, highlighting the importance of promoting alternatives as a part of longer-term behavioural and lifestyle changes.","['Anna Pernestål', 'Yusak Susilo', 'Claudia Andruetto', 'Elisa Bin']",10.1186/s12544-021-00473-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12544-021-00473-7,2,2021,The trade-off behaviours between virtual and physical activities during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic period,European Transport Research Review,"(['Mechanical Engineering', 'Transportation', 'Automotive Engineering'],)",,Transport Phenomena

"The OER movement has tended to define ""openness"" in terms of access to use and reuse educational materials, and to address the geographical and financial barriers among students, teachers and self-learners with open access to high quality digital educational resources. MOOCs are the continuation of this trend of openness, innovation, and use of technology to provide learning opportunities for large numbers of learners. In the last years, the amount of Open Educational Resources on the Web has increased dramatically, especially thanks to initiatives like OpenCourseWare and other Open Educational Resources movements. The potential of this vast amount of resources is enormous. In this paper an architecture based on Semantic Web technologies and the Linked Data guidelines to support the inclusion of open materials in massive online courses is presented. Linked Data is considered as one of the most effective alternatives for creating global shared information spaces, it has become an interesting approach for discovering and enriching open educational resources data, as well as achieving semantic interoperability and re-use between multiple Open Educational Resources repositories. The notion of Linked Data refers to a set of best practices for publishing, sharing and interconnecting data in RDF format. Educational repositories managers are, in fact, realizing the potential of using Linked Data for describing, discovering, linking and publishing educational data on the Web. This work shows a data architecture based on semantic web technologies that support the discovery and inclusion of open educational materials in massive online courses in engineering education. The authors focus on a type of openness: open of contents as regards re-use and re-mix, i.e. freedom to reuse the material, to combine it with other materials, to adapt and to share it further under an open license.

"Web Table Understanding in the context of Knowledge Base Population and the Semantic Web is the task of i) linking the content of tables retrieved from the Web to an RDF knowledge base, ii) of building hypotheses about the tables' structures and contents, iii) of extracting novel information from these tables, and iv) of adding this new information to a knowledge base. Knowledge Base Population has gained more and more interest in the last years due to the increased demand in large knowledge graphs which became relevant for Artificial Intelligence applications such as Question Answering and Semantic Search. In this paper we describe a set of basic tasks which are relevant for Web Table Understanding in the mentioned context. These tasks incrementally enrich a table with hypotheses about the table's content. In doing so, in the case of multiple interpretations, selecting one interpretation and thus deciding against other interpretations is avoided as much as possible. By postponing these decision, we enable table understanding approaches to decide by themselves, thus increasing the usability of the annotated table data. We present statistics from analyzing and annotating 1.000.000 tables from the Web Table Corpus 2015 and make this dataset as well as our code available online.

"A high quality of master data is vital for process automation and IS support in enterprises. Retailers and manufacturers have started improving their master data quality on a syntactical level. Many researchers address problems of syntactical master data quality (e.g. missing values, typo errors), but only few approaches target semantic issues of master data quality management. Poor semantic data quality can lead to a misalignment between real-world phenomena and data stored in the databases. Furthermore, semantic data quality relies on the current use of data, but is not limited to the present use of the data and its impact on existing business processes. In fact it includes the likely future uses of the data as well. In this paper, we discuss the contribution of ontologies for identifying and assessing semantic master data quality problems. We develop a conceptual approach and procedure model for addressing the semantic master data quality problem. The method is applied within a scenario for automated coupon clearing in the retail industry.

"Despite rapid progress, most of the educational technologies today lack a strong instructional design knowledge basis leading to questionable quality of instruction. In addition, a major challenge is to customize these educational technologies for a wide range of customizable instructional designs. Ontologies are one of the pertinent mechanisms to represent instructional design in the literature. However, existing approaches do not support modeling of flexible instructional designs. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose an ontology based framework for systematic modeling of different aspects of instructional design knowledge based on domain patterns. As part of the framework, we present ontologies for modeling goals, instructional processes and instructional material. We demonstrate the ontology framework by presenting instances of the ontology for the large scale case study of adult literacy in India (287 million learners spread across 22 Indian Languages), which requires creation of hundreds of similar but varied eLearning Systems based on flexible instructional designs. The implemented framework is available at <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" ext-link-type=""uri"" xlink:href=""http://rice.iiit.ac.in"">http://rice.iiit.ac.in</jats:ext-link> and is transferred to National Literacy Mission Authority of Government of India.

"With the increased dependence on online learning platforms and educational resource repositories, a unified representation of digital learning resources becomes essential to support a dynamic and multisource learning experience. We introduce the EduCOR ontology, an educational, career-oriented ontology that provides a foundation for representing online learning resources for personalised learning systems. The ontology is designed to enable learning material repositories to offer learning path recommendations, which correspond to the user’s learning goals, academic and psychological parameters, and the labour-market skills. We present the multiple patterns that compose the EduCOR ontology, highlighting its cross-domain applicability and integrability with other ontologies. A demonstration of the proposed ontology on the reallife learning platform eDoer is discussed as a use-case. We evaluate the EduCOR ontology using both gold standard and task-based approaches. The comparison of EduCOR to three gold schemata, and its application in two use-cases, shows its coverage and adaptability to multiple OER repositories, which allows generating user-centric and labour-market oriented recommendations.

"Motivated by evolving business requirements and novel enterprise applications, we propose and implement the Semantic Master Data Management (SMDM), a semantics-level enhancement to the existing MDM solutions. The SMDM system publishes relational-based master data as virtual RDF store, and injects instantaneous reasoning capabilities into semantic queries. Two kinds of ontologies are introduced to the system, the core MDM ontology and the external imported domain ontology. SMDM enables data linking among multi-domains, implicit relationship discovery, and declarative definition and extension of business policies and entities. Based on these functions, modern companies can customize their applications and services on demand within the MDM hub. In the demonstration, we build the system environment based on IBM's MDM solution, and run the use cases on the master data of an insurance company.","['Yong Yu', 'Yue Pan', 'Kang Zhang', 'Nick Kanellos', 'Li Ma', 'Feng Cao', 'Xingzhi Sun', 'Xiaoyuan Wang']",10.14778/1687553.1687600,http://dx.doi.org/10.14778/1687553.1687600,8,2009,SMDM: enhancing enterprise-wide master data management using semantic web technologies,Proceedings of the VLDB EndowmentAugust 2009 ,"([],)",,Data Storage Systems

"In this paper, we introduce a new vision-language pre-trained model -- ImageBERT -- for image-text joint embedding. Our model is a Transformer-based model, which takes different modalities as input and models the relationship between them. The model is pre-trained on four tasks simultaneously: Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Object Classification (MOC), Masked Region Feature Regression (MRFR), and Image Text Matching (ITM). To further enhance the pre-training quality, we have collected a Large-scale weAk-supervised Image-Text (LAIT) dataset from Web. We first pre-train the model on this dataset, then conduct a second stage pre-training on Conceptual Captions and SBU Captions. Our experiments show that multi-stage pre-training strategy outperforms single-stage pre-training. We also fine-tune and evaluate our pre-trained ImageBERT model on image retrieval and text retrieval tasks, and achieve new state-of-the-art results on both MSCOCO and Flickr30k datasets.

"An essential method to investigate neuromodulation effects of an invasive neural interface (INI) is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Presently, MRI imaging of patients with neural implants is highly restricted in high field MRI (e.g., 3 T and higher) due to patient safety concerns. This results in lower resolution MRI images and, consequently, degrades the efficacy of MRI imaging for diagnostic purposes in these patients. Cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC) is a biocompatible wide-band-gap semiconductor with a high thermal conductivity and magnetic susceptibility compatible with brain tissue. It also has modifiable electrical conductivity through doping level control. These properties can improve the MRI compliance of 3C-SiC INIs, specifically in high field MRI scanning. In this work, the MRI compliance of epitaxial SiC films grown on various Si wafers, used to implement a monolithic neural implant (all-SiC), was studied. Via finite element method (FEM) and Fourier-based simulations, the specific absorption rate (SAR), induced heating, and image artifacts caused by the portion of the implant within a brain tissue phantom located in a 7 T small animal MRI machine were estimated and measured. The specific goal was to compare implant materials; thus, the effect of leads outside the tissue was not considered. The results of the simulations were validated via phantom experiments in the same 7 T MRI system. The simulation and experimental results revealed that free-standing 3C-SiC films had little to no image artifacts compared to silicon and platinum reference materials inside the MRI at 7 T. In addition, FEM simulations predicted an ~30% SAR reduction for 3C-SiC compared to Pt. These initial simulations and experiments indicate an all-SiC INI may effectively reduce MRI induced heating and image artifacts in high field MRI. In order to evaluate the MRI safety of a closed-loop, fully functional all-SiC INI as per ISO/TS 10974:2018 standard, additional research and development is being conducted and will be reported at a later date.","['Stephen Saddow', 'Francesco La Via', 'Christopher Frewin', 'Gokhan Mumcu', 'Chenyin Feng', 'William Dominguez-Viqueira', 'Mohammad Beygi']",10.3390/mi12020126,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/mi12020126,1,2021,Silicon Carbide and MRI: Towards Developing a MRI Safe Neural Interface,Micromachines,"(['Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Control and Systems Engineering'],)",,Electronic Devices and Semiconductor Manufacturing
"Laser-assisted doping of intrinsic silicon carbide (SiC) films deposited on Si (100) substrates by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method and its influence on simultaneous annealing of the thin film is studied. PLD grown intrinsic SiC films are transformed to p-type SiC and n-type SiC, using laser-assisted doping in aqueous aluminum chloride and phosphoric solutions, respectively. Simultaneous doping and annealing of the SiC film are observed during laser-assisted doping. By precisely positioning the selectively doped region, lateral p–n diodes are formed on the SiC films without using any mask. Electric characteristics confirmed the formation of a lateral p–n diode structure. Numerical analysis of temperature distribution along the depth of the SiC films explains the mechanism of simultaneous doping and annealing during the laser treatment.","['Tiju Thomas', 'Hiroshi Ikenoue', 'M.

"To achieve high accuracy in prediction, a load forecasting algorithm must model various consumer behaviors in response to weather conditions or special events. Different triggers will have various effects on different customers and lead to difficulties in constructing an adequate prediction model due to non-stationary and uncertain characteristics in load variations. This paper proposes an open-ended model of short-term load forecasting (STLF) which has general prediction ability to capture the non-linear relationship between the load demand and the exogenous inputs. The prediction method uses the whale optimization algorithm, discrete wavelet transform, and multiple linear regression model (WOA-DWT-MLR model) to predict both system load and aggregated load of power consumers. WOA is used to optimize the best combination of detail and approximation signals from DWT to construct an optimal MLR model. The proposed model is validated with both the system-side data set and the end-user data set for Independent System Operator-New England (ISO-NE) and smart meter load data, respectively, based on Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) criterion. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves lower prediction error than existing methods and can have consistent prediction of non-stationary load conditions that exist in both test systems.

"Hybrid energy systems (HESs) generate electricity from multiple energy sources that complement each other. Recently, due to the reduction in costs of photovoltaic (PV) modules and wind turbines, these types of systems have become economically competitive. In this study, a mathematical programming model is applied to evaluate the techno-economic feasibility of autonomous units located in two isolated areas of Ecuador: first, the province of Galapagos (subtropical island) and second, the province of Morona Santiago (Amazonian tropical forest). The two case studies suggest that HESs are potential solutions to reduce the dependence of rural villages on fossil fuels and viable mechanisms to bring electrical power to isolated communities in Ecuador. Our results reveal that not only from the economic but also from the environmental point of view, for the case of the Galapagos province, a hybrid energy system with a PV–wind–battery configuration and a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) equal to 0.36 $/kWh is the optimal energy supply system. For the case of Morona Santiago, a hybrid energy system with a PV–diesel–battery configuration and an LCOE equal to 0.37 $/kWh is the most suitable configuration to meet the load of a typical isolated community in Ecuador. The proposed optimization model can be used as a decision-support tool for evaluating the viability of autonomous HES projects at any other location.","['Jacek Kamiński', 'Adam Suski', 'Pablo Benalcazar']",10.3390/en13153933,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/15/3933,8,2020,Optimal Sizing and Scheduling of Hybrid Energy Systems: The Cases of Morona Santiago and the Galapagos Islands,"['Energies', 'Energies']","(['Energy (miscellaneous)', 'Energy Engineering and Power Technology', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Control and Optimization', 'Engineering (miscellaneous)'],)",,Power and Energy
"The purpose of the study was to examine the potential of palm biomass, taking a case of the Juaben Oil Mills in the Ashanti Region of Ghana, which has over the years generated electricity for its operations from its waste products and other benefits that have accrued to the company and the host community. Primary data collection and intensive desk study approaches were employed albeit qualitatively, to describe the use of palm biomass as supplementary source of electricity generation in Ghana. The study showed that there is enough potential (waste by-products) for electricity generation to supplement current production from hydropower to meet growing demand. However, policy and institutional arrangements do not easily allow generation and extension for communal benefits. The authors therefore recommend a relook at existing policy and institutional arrangements to help promote this alternative source of energy for efficient and sustainable domestic and industrial uses. We also argue that ensuring efficiency in energy generation calls for R&amp;D into its commercial potential and explore more efficient means of managing industrial and other agro biofuel wastes in developing economies. Future energy policy must also create and harness diversity of available biomass resources and reduce the delivery risks of the resources.","['Eric K Adabor', 'Vivian Yeboah', 'Michael O Asibey']",10.1177/0958305x17744079,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0958305x17744079,12,2017,Palm biomass waste as supplementary source of electricity generation in Ghana: Case of the Juaben Oil Mills,Energy & Environment,"(['Energy (miscellaneous)', 'Energy Engineering and Power Technology', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Environmental Engineering'],)",,Power and Energy

"The application of thinner cadmium sulfide (CdS) window layer is a feasible approach to improve the performance of cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin film solar cells. However, the reduction of compactness and continuity of thinner CdS always deteriorates the device performance. In this work, transparent Al2O3 films with different thicknesses, deposited by using atomic layer deposition (ALD), were utilized as buffer layers between the front electrode transparent conductive oxide (TCO) and CdS layers to solve this problem, and then, thin-film solar cells with a structure of TCO/Al2O3/CdS/CdTe/BC/Ni were fabricated. The characteristics of the ALD-Al2O3 films were studied by UV–visible transmittance spectrum, Raman spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The light and dark J–V performances of solar cells were also measured by specific instrumentations. The transmittance measurement conducted on the TCO/Al2O3 films verified that the transmittance of TCO/Al2O3 were comparable to that of single TCO layer, meaning that no extra absorption loss occurred when Al2O3 buffer layers were introduced into cells. Furthermore, due to the advantages of the ALD method, the ALD-Al2O3 buffer layers formed an extremely continuous and uniform coverage on the substrates to effectively fill and block the tiny leakage channels in CdS/CdTe polycrystalline films and improve the characteristics of the interface between TCO and CdS. However, as the thickness of alumina increased, the negative effects of cells were gradually exposed, especially the increase of the series resistance (Rs) and the more serious “roll-over” phenomenon. Finally, the cell conversion efficiency (η) of more than 13.0% accompanied by optimized uniformity performances was successfully achieved corresponding to the 10 nm thick ALD-Al2O3 thin film.","['Qionghua Wang', 'Lianghuan Feng', 'Shengqiang Ren', 'Xia Hao', 'Guanggen Zeng']",10.3390/en12061123,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en12061123,3,2019,Application of ALD-Al2O3 in CdS/CdTe Thin-Film Solar Cells,Energies,"(['Energy (miscellaneous)', 'Energy Engineering and Power Technology', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Control and Optimization', 'Engineering (miscellaneous)'],)",,Semiconductor and Optical Materials

"A search of the recent literature reveals that there is a continuous growth of scientific publications on the development of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes for silicon carbide (SiC) films and their promising applications in micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS) devices. In recent years, considerable effort has been devoted to deposit high-quality SiC films on large areas enabling the low-cost fabrication methods of MEMS/NEMS sensors. The relatively high temperatures involved in CVD SiC growth are a drawback and studies have been made to develop low-temperature CVD processes. In this respect, atomic layer deposition (ALD), a modified CVD process promising for nanotechnology fabrication techniques, has attracted attention due to the deposition of thin films at low temperatures and additional benefits, such as excellent uniformity, conformability, good reproducibility, large area, and batch capability. This review article focuses on the recent advances in the strategies for the CVD of SiC films, with a special emphasis on low-temperature processes, as well as ALD. In addition, we summarize the applications of CVD SiC films in MEMS/NEMS devices and prospects for advancement of the CVD SiC technology.","['Rodrigo Pessoa', 'Mariana Fraga']",10.3390/mi11090799,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/mi11090799,8,2020,Progresses in Synthesis and Application of SiC Films: From CVD to ALD and from MEMS to NEMS,Micromachines,"(['Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Control and Systems Engineering'],)",,Semiconductor and Optical Materials

"Optical 3D geometry reconstruction, or more specific, fringe projection profilometry, is a state-of-the-art technique for the measurement of the shape of objects in confined spaces or under rough environmental conditions, e.g., while inspecting a wrought-hot specimen after a forging operation. While the contact-less method enables the measurement of such an object, the results are influenced by the light deflection effect occurring due to the inhomogeneous refractive index field induced by the hot air around the measurand. However, the developed active compensation methods to fight this issue exhibits a major drawback, namely an additional cooling of the object and a subsequent transient illumination component. In this paper, we investigate the cooling and its effect on temporal phase reconstruction algorithms and take a theoretical approach to its compensation. The simulated compensation measures are transferred to a fringe projection profilometry setup and are evaluated using established and newly developed methods. The results show a significant improvement when measuring specimens under a transient illumination and are easily transferable to any kind of multi-frequency phase-shift measurement.","['Reithmeier, Eduard', 'Kästner, Markus', 'Kern, Pascal', 'Reinke, Carl', 'Beermann, Rüdiger', 'Quentin, Lorenz']",10.3390/s21051599,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/5/1599,2,0,Adapted Fringe Projection Sequences for Changing Illumination Conditions on the Example of Measuring a Wrought-Hot Object Influenced by Forced Cooling ,Sensors 21(5),"(['Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Biochemistry', 'Instrumentation', 'Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics', 'Analytical Chemistry'],)",,Mechanical Engineering

"The interaction human-vehicle, as well as driver’s behavior are subject long debated in the automotive engineering domain. Driving simulators have an extraordinary important role allowing research that would not be possible to study in real world scenarios.               A driver uses his sensory inputs to obtain the required input to base his decision on. The bandwidth of the required input signal should be in accordance to the driver’s task. For simple tasks, like turning on the screen wipers or direction indicator, low frequency information is sufficient. High frequency information is required when cornering on a busy road or when driving in relatively limit situations.               The optimal configuration of each sub-system remains a significant cause for debate and still poses a major challenge when considering the ability of simulators to extract realistic driver behavior. If a difference is observed between real and virtual conditions, the factors specifically cause these differences are very difficult to be explained.","['Thomas Brandemeir', 'Mircea Oprean', 'Valerian Croitorescu', 'Alexandra Tucă']",10.1515/cplbu-2015-0034,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/cplbu-2015-0034,11,2015,Driving Simulators for Human Vehicle Interaction Design,Balkan Region Conference on Engineering and Business Education,"([],)",,Applied Mechanics

"Hybrid energy systems (HESs) generate electricity from multiple energy sources that complement each other. Recently, due to the reduction in costs of photovoltaic (PV) modules and wind turbines, these types of systems have become economically competitive. In this study, a mathematical programming model is applied to evaluate the techno-economic feasibility of autonomous units located in two isolated areas of Ecuador: first, the province of Galapagos (subtropical island) and second, the province of Morona Santiago (Amazonian tropical forest). The two case studies suggest that HESs are potential solutions to reduce the dependence of rural villages on fossil fuels and viable mechanisms to bring electrical power to isolated communities in Ecuador. Our results reveal that not only from the economic but also from the environmental point of view, for the case of the Galapagos province, a hybrid energy system with a PV–wind–battery configuration and a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) equal to 0.36 $/kWh is the optimal energy supply system. For the case of Morona Santiago, a hybrid energy system with a PV–diesel–battery configuration and an LCOE equal to 0.37 $/kWh is the most suitable configuration to meet the load of a typical isolated community in Ecuador. The proposed optimization model can be used as a decision-support tool for evaluating the viability of autonomous HES projects at any other location.","['Jacek Kamiński', 'Adam Suski', 'Pablo Benalcazar']",10.3390/en13153933,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/15/3933,8,2020,Optimal Sizing and Scheduling of Hybrid Energy Systems: The Cases of Morona Santiago and the Galapagos Islands,"['Energies', 'Energies']","(['Energy (miscellaneous)', 'Energy Engineering and Power Technology', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Control and Optimization', 'Engineering (miscellaneous)'],)",,Energy Systems

"Resource saving has become an integral aspect of manufacturing in industry 4.0. This paper proposes a multisystem optimization (MSO) algorithm, inspired by implicit parallelism of heuristic methods, to solve an integrated production scheduling with resource saving problem in textile printing and dyeing. First, a real-world integrated production scheduling with resource saving is formulated as a multisystem optimization problem. Then, the MSO algorithm is proposed to solve multisystem optimization problems that consist of several coupled subsystems, and each of the subsystems may contain multiple objectives and multiple constraints. The proposed MSO algorithm is composed of within-subsystem evolution and cross-subsystem migration operators, and the former is to optimize each subsystem by excellent evolution operators and the later is to complete information sharing between multiple subsystems, to accelerate the global optimization of the whole system. Performance is tested on a set of multisystem benchmark functions and compared with improved NSGA-II and multiobjective multifactorial evolutionary algorithm (MO-MFEA). Simulation results show that the MSO algorithm is better than compared algorithms for the benchmark functions studied in this paper. Finally, the MSO algorithm is successfully applied to the proposed integrated production scheduling with resource saving problem, and the results show that MSO is a promising algorithm for the studied problem.","['Huiyu Zhou', 'Zhile Yang', 'Jinglin Wang', 'Chao Sun', 'Haiping Ma']",10.1155/2020/8853735,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/8853735,11,2020,Multisystem Optimization for an Integrated Production Scheduling with Resource Saving Problem in Textile Printing and Dyeing,Complexity,"(['Multidisciplinary', 'General Computer Science'],)",,"Operations Research, Systems Engineering and Industrial Engineering"
"The growing increase in world energy consumption favors the search for renewable energy sources. One of the existing options for the growth and sustainable development of such types of sources is through the use of biomass as an input. The employment of biomass as solid fuel is widely studied and is no longer a novelty nor presents any difficulty from the technical point of view. It presents, however, logistic obstacles, thus not allowing their direct dissemination in every organization that is willing to replace it as an energy source. Use of biomass can be rewarding due to the fact that it can bring significant economic gains attained due to the steadiness of the biomass price in Portugal. However, the price may rise as predicted in the coming years, although it will be a gradual rising. The main goal of this study was to analyze whether biomass in the case of the Portuguese textile industry can be a viable alternative that separates the possibility of sustainable growth from the lack of competitiveness due to high energy costs. The study showed that biomass can be a reliable, sustainable and permanent energy alternative to more traditional energy sources such as propane gas, naphtha and natural gas for the textile industry. At the same time, it can bring savings of 35% in energy costs related to steam generation.

"Flexible Job shop scheduling problem (FJSSP) is one of scheduling problems with specification: there is a job to be done in a certain order, each job contains a number of operations and each operation is processed on a machine of some available machine. The purpose of this paper is to solve Multi-objective Flexible Job Shop scheduling problem with minimizing the makespan, the biggest workload and the total workload of all machines. Because of complexity these problem, a integrated approach Immune Algorithm (IA) and Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm are combined to solve the multi-objective FJSSP. A clonal selection is a strategy for generating new antibody based on selecting the antibody for reproduction. SA is used as a local search search algorithm for enhancing the local ability with certain probability to avoid becoming trapped in a local optimum.

"Technological innovations, customer expectations in particular, and globalization in general have reinforced the nessecity to increase productivity. There is constant market changes with decreased life cycle of products, rapid technological developments and more demanding customers. In order to improve productivity, industrial enterprises turn to either ameliorate their production or the maintenance of their equipment, parallelly with the cost function in both cases. Nonetheless, these two methods are disadvantageous because they make their neighboring function to suffer, thereby creating the inverse effects of those initially expected. Moreover, seeking to increase performance in the current industrial systems leads the integration of various services in the global management of manufacturing firms. This paper, aims to demostrate that increasing productivity requires the interaction between the production and maintenance functions. However, this interaction must be well structured for a better efficiency. In fact, industrial productivity cannot be adequately improved if the collaborative approach, ""production-maintenance"", is not effective in an enterprise.

In health-care systems, Internet of Technology (IoT) technologies provide data exchange among various entities and ontologies offer a formal description to present the knowledge of health-care domains. These ontologies are advised to assure the quality of their adoption and applicability in the real world.<jats:title content-type=""-subheading"">Design/methodology/approachOntology assessment is an integral part of ontology construction and maintenance. It is always performed to identify inconsistencies and modeling errors by the experts during the ontology development. A smart health-care ontology (SHCO) has been designed to deal with health-care information and IoT devices. In this paper, an integrated approach has been proposed to assess the SHCO on different assessment tools such as Themis, Test-Driven Development (TDD)onto, Protégé and OOPs! Several test cases are framed to assess the ontology on these tools, in this research, Themis and TDDonto tools provide the verification for the test cases while Protégé and OOPs! provides validation of modeled knowledge in the ontology.<jats:title content-type=""-subheading"">FindingsAs of the best knowledge, no other study has been presented earlier to conduct the integrated assessment on different tools.

"E-learning recommender systems are gaining significance nowadays due to its ability to enhance the learning experience by providing tailor-made services based on learner preferences. A Personalized Learning Environment (PLE) that automatically adapts to learner characteristics such as learning styles and knowledge level can recommend appropriate learning resources that would favor the learning process and improve learning outcomes. The pure cold-start problem is a relevant issue in PLEs, which arises due to the lack of prior information about the new learner in the PLE to create appropriate recommendations. This article introduces a semantic framework based on ontology to address the pure cold-start problem in content recommenders. The ontology encapsulates the domain knowledge about the learners as well as Learning Objects (LOs). The semantic model that we built has been experimented with different combinations of the key learner parameters such as learning style, knowledge level, and background knowledge. The proposed framework utilizes these parameters to build natural learner groups from the learner ontology using SPARQL queries. The ontology holds 480 learners’ data, 468 annotated learning objects with 5,600 learner ratings. A multivariate k-means clustering algorithm, an unsupervised machine learning technique for grouping similar data, is used to evaluate the learner similarity computation accuracy. The learner satisfaction achieved with the proposed model is measured based on the ratings given by the 40 participants of the experiments. From the evaluation perspective, it is evident that 79% of the learners are satisfied with the recommendations generated by the proposed model in pure cold-start condition.","['Renumol V.

"With the increased adoption of the FAIR Principles, a wide range of stakeholders, from scientists to publishers, funding agencies and policy makers, are seeking ways to transparently evaluate resource FAIRness. We describe the FAIR Evaluator, a software infrastructure to register and execute tests of compliance with the recently published FAIR Metrics. The Evaluator enables digital resources to be assessed objectively and transparently. We illustrate its application to three widely used generalist repositories - Dataverse, Dryad, and Zenodo - and report their feedback. Evaluations allow communities to select relevant Metric subsets to deliver FAIRness measurements in diverse and specialized applications. Evaluations are executed in a semi-automated manner through Web Forms filled-in by a user, or through a JSON-based API. A comparison of manual vs automated evaluation reveals that automated evaluations are generally stricter, resulting in lower, though more accurate, FAIRness scores. Finally, we highlight the need for enhanced infrastructure such as standards registries, like FAIRsharing, as well as additional community involvement in domain-specific data infrastructure creation.","['Erik Schultes', 'Mercè Crosas', 'Derek Murphy', 'Julian Gautier', 'Peter McQuilton', 'Mario Prieto', 'Luiz Olavo Bonino da Silva Santos', 'Susanna-Assunta Sansone', 'Michel Dumontier', 'Mark D.

"The FAIR principles were received with broad acceptance in several scientific communities. However, there is still some degree of uncertainty on how they should be implemented. Several self-report questionnaires have been proposed to assess the implementation of the FAIR principles. Moreover, the FAIRmetrics group released 14, general-purpose maturity for representing FAIRness. Initially, these metrics were conducted as open-answer questionnaires. Recently, these metrics have been implemented into a software that can automatically harvest metadata from metadata providers and generate a principle-specific FAIRness evaluation. With so many different approaches for FAIRness evaluations, we believe that further clarification on their limitations and advantages, as well as on their interpretation and interplay should be considered.","['Michel Dumontier', 'Ricardo de Miranda Azevedo']",10.1162/dint_a_00051,https://direct.mit.edu/dint/article-pdf/2/1-2/285/1893427/dint_a_00051.pdf,0,2020,Considerations for the Conduction and Interpretation of FAIRness Evaluations,"['Data Intelligence', 'Data Intelligence', 'Data Intelligence']","([],)",,Information Science

"More than three years have passed since the release of the second edition of VocBench, an open source collaborative web platform for the development of thesauri complying with Semantic Web standards. In these years, a vibrant user community has gathered around the system, consisting of public organizations, companies and independent users looking for open source solutions for maintaining their thesauri, code lists and authority resources. The focus on collaboration, the differentiation of user roles and the workflow management for content validation and publication have been the strengths of the platform, especially for those organizations requiring a centralized and controlled publication environment. Now the time has come to widen the scope of the platform: funded by the ISA2programme of the European Commission, VocBench 3 will offer a general-purpose collaborative environment for development of any kind of RDF dataset, improving the editing capabilities of its predecessor, while still maintaining the peculiar aspects that determined its success. In this paper, we review the requirements and the new objectives set for version 3, and then introduce the new characteristics that were implemented for this next iteration of the platform.

"One of the disciplines behind the science of science is the study of scientific networks. This work focuses on scientific networks as a social network having different nodes and connections. Nodes can be represented by authors, articles or journals while connections by citation, co-citation or co-authorship. One of the challenges in creating scientific networks is the lack of publicly available comprehensive data set. It limits the variety of analyses on the same set of nodes of different scientific networks. To supplement such analyses we have worked on publicly available citation metadata from Crossref and OpenCitatons. Using this data a workflow is developed to create scientific networks. Analysis of these networks gives insights into academic research and scholarship. Different techniques of social network analysis have been applied in the literature to study these networks. It includes centrality analysis, community detection, and clustering coefficient. We have used metadata of Scientometrics journal, as a case study, to present our workflow. We did a sample run of the proposed workflow to identify prominent authors using centrality analysis. This work is not a bibliometric study of any field rather it presents replicable Python scripts to perform network analysis. With an increase in the popularity of open access and open metadata, we hypothesise that this workflow shall provide an avenue for understanding scientific scholarship in multiple dimensions.","['Muhammad Sabih', 'Muhammad Rafi', 'Bilal H.

"Background                Knowledge is often produced from data generated in scientific investigations. An ever-growing number of scientific studies in several domains result into a massive amount of data, from which obtaining new knowledge requires computational help. For example, Alzheimer’s Disease, a life-threatening degenerative disease that is not yet curable. As the scientific community strives to better understand it and find a cure, great amounts of data have been generated, and new knowledge can be produced. A proper representation of such knowledge brings great benefits to researchers, to the scientific community, and consequently, to society.                              Methods                In this article, we study and evaluate a semi-automatic method that generates knowledge graphs (KGs) from biomedical texts in the scientific literature. Our solution explores natural language processing techniques with the aim of extracting and representing scientific literature knowledge encoded in KGs. Our method links entities and relations represented in KGs to concepts from existing biomedical ontologies available on the Web. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by generating KGs from unstructured texts obtained from a set of s taken from scientific papers on the Alzheimer’s Disease. We involve physicians to compare our extracted triples from their manual extraction via their analysis of the s. The evaluation further concerned a qualitative analysis by the physicians of the generated KGs with our software tool.                              Results                The experimental results indicate the quality of the generated KGs. The proposed method extracts a great amount of triples, showing the effectiveness of our rule-based method employed in the identification of relations in texts. In addition, ontology links are successfully obtained, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the ontology linking method proposed in this investigation.                              Conclusions                We demonstrate that our proposal is effective on building ontology-linked KGs representing the knowledge obtained from biomedical scientific texts. Such representation can add value to the research in various domains, enabling researchers to compare the occurrence of concepts from different studies. The KGs generated may pave the way to potential proposal of new theories based on data analysis to advance the state of the art in their research domains.","['Hélène de Ribaupierre', 'Ricardo da Silva Torres', 'Julio Cesar dos Reis', 'Anderson Rossanez']",10.1186/s12911-020-01341-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12911-020-01341-5,12,2020,KGen: a knowledge graph generator from biomedical scientific literature,BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,"(['Health Informatics', 'Health Policy', 'Computer Science Applications'],)",,Information Science

"For research institutes, data libraries, and data archives, validating RDF data according to predefined constraints is a much sought-after feature, particularly as this is taken for granted in the XML world. Based on our work in two international working groups on RDF validation and jointly identified requirements to formulate constraints and validate RDF data, we have published 81 types of constraints that are required by various stakeholders for data applications.  In this paper, we evaluate the usability of identified constraint types for assessing RDF data quality by (1) collecting and classifying 115 constraints on vocabularies commonly used in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences, either from the vocabularies themselves or from domain experts, and (2) validating 15,694 data sets (4.26 billion triples) of research data against these constraints. We classify each constraint according to (1) the severity of occurring violations and (2) based on which types of constraint languages are able to express its constraint type. Based on the large-scale evaluation, we formulate several findings to direct the further development of constraint languages.","['Kai Eckert', 'Joachim Wackerow', 'Benjamin Zapilko', 'Thomas Hartmann']",10.1142/s1793351x16400079,http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/s1793351x16400079,0,2016,Directing the development of constraint languages by checking constraints on rdf data,International Journal of Semantic Computing,"(['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Networks and Communications', 'Computer Science Applications', 'Linguistics and Language', 'Information Systems', 'Software'],)",,Information Science

"In many data-centric semantic web applications, it is desirable to use OWL to encode the Integrity Constraints (IC) that must be satisfied by instance data. However, challenges arise due to the Open World Assumption (OWA) and the lack of a Unique Name Assumption (UNA) in OWL's standard semantics. In particular, conditions that trigger constraint violations in systems using the Closed World Assumption (CWA), will generate new inferences in standard OWL-based reasoning applications. In this paper, we present an alternative IC semantics for OWL that allows applications to work with the CWA and the weak UNA. Ontology modelers can choose which OWL axioms to be interpreted with our IC semantics. Thus application developers are able to combine open world reasoning with closed world constraint validation in a flexible way. We also show that IC validation can be reduced to query answering under certain conditions. Finally, we describe our prototype implementation based on the OWL reasoner Pellet.

"Background Data papers have emerged as a powerful instrument for open data publishing, obtaining credit, and establishing priority for datasets generated in scientific experiments. Academic publishing improves data and metadata quality through peer review and increases the impact of datasets by enhancing their visibility, accessibility, and reusability. Objective We aimed to establish a new type of article structure and template for omics studies: the omics data paper. To improve data interoperability and further incentivize researchers to publish well-described datasets, we created a prototype workflow for streamlined import of genomics metadata from the European Nucleotide Archive directly into a data paper manuscript. Methods An omics data paper template was designed by defining key article sections that encourage the description of omics datasets and methodologies. A metadata import workflow, based on REpresentational State Transfer services and Xpath, was prototyped to extract information from the European Nucleotide Archive, ArrayExpress, and BioSamples databases. Findings The template and workflow for automatic import of standard-compliant metadata into an omics data paper manuscript provide a mechanism for enhancing existing metadata through publishing. Conclusion The omics data paper structure and workflow for import of genomics metadata will help to bring genomic and other omics datasets into the spotlight. Promoting enhanced metadata descriptions and enforcing manuscript peer review and data auditing of the underlying datasets brings additional quality to datasets. We hope that streamlined metadata reuse for scholarly publishing encourages authors to create enhanced metadata descriptions in the form of data papers to improve both the quality of their metadata and its findability and accessibility.","['Lyubomir Penev', 'Vincent Smith', 'Seyhan Demirov', 'Georgi Zhelezov', 'Teodor Georgiev', 'Pier Luigi Buttigieg', 'Raïssa Meyer', 'Mariya Dimitrova']",10.1093/gigascience/giab034,https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article-pdf/10/5/giab034/37930729/giab034.pdf,5,2021,"A streamlined workflow for conversion, peer review, and publication of genomics metadata as omics data papers ",GigaScience,,['Medicine'],Information Science

"Modelling language change is an increasingly important area of interest within the fields of sociolinguistics and historical linguistics. In recent years, there has been a growing number of publications whose main concern is studying changes that have occurred within the past centuries. The Corpus of Historical American English (COHA) is one of the most commonly used large corpora in diachronic studies in English. This paper describes methods applied to the downloadable version of the COHA corpus in order to overcome its main limitations, such as inconsistent lemmas and malformed tokens, without compromising its qualitative and distributional properties. The resulting corpus CCOHA contains a larger number of cleaned word tokens which can offer better insights into language change and allow for a larger variety of tasks to be performed.

"<jats:title content-type=""-subheading"">PurposeHealth-care ontologies and their terminologies play a vital role in knowledge representation and data integration for health information. In health-care systems, Internet of Technology (IoT) technologies provide data exchange among various entities and ontologies offer a formal description to present the knowledge of health-care domains. These ontologies are advised to assure the quality of their adoption and applicability in the real world.<jats:title content-type=""-subheading"">Design/methodology/approachOntology assessment is an integral part of ontology construction and maintenance. It is always performed to identify inconsistencies and modeling errors by the experts during the ontology development. A smart health-care ontology (SHCO) has been designed to deal with health-care information and IoT devices. In this paper, an integrated approach has been proposed to assess the SHCO on different assessment tools such as Themis, Test-Driven Development (TDD)onto, Protégé and OOPs! Several test cases are framed to assess the ontology on these tools, in this research, Themis and TDDonto tools provide the verification for the test cases while Protégé and OOPs! provides validation of modeled knowledge in the ontology.<jats:title content-type=""-subheading"">FindingsAs of the best knowledge, no other study has been presented earlier to conduct the integrated assessment on different tools.

"Hierarchical clustering has been shown to be valuable in many scenarios. Despite its usefulness to many situations, there is no agreed methodology on how to properly evaluate the hierarchies produced from different techniques, particularly in the case where ground-truth labels are unavailable. This motivates us to propose a framework for assessing the quality of hierarchical clustering allocations which covers the case of no ground-truth information. This measurement is useful, e.g., to assess the hierarchical structures used by online retailer websites to display their product catalogues. Our framework is one of the few attempts for the hierarchy evaluation from a decision-theoretic perspective. We model the process as a bot searching stochastically for items in the hierarchy and establish a measure representing the degree to which the hierarchy supports this search. We employ Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) to model the uncertainty, the decision making, and the cognitive return for searchers in such a scenario.

"Social platforms became a major source of rumours. While rumours can have severe real-world implications, their detection is notoriously hard: Content on social platforms is short and lacks semantics; it spreads quickly through a dynamically evolving network; and without considering the context of content, it may be impossible to arrive at a truthful interpretation. Traditional approaches to rumour detection, however, exploit solely a single content modality, e.g., social media posts, which limits their detection accuracy. In this paper, we cope with the aforementioned challenges by means of a multi-modal approach to rumour detection that identifies anomalies in both, the entities (e.g., users, posts, and hashtags) of a social platform and their relations. Based on local anomalies, we show how to detect rumours at the network level, following a graph-based scan approach. In addition, we propose incremental methods, which enable us to detect rumours using streaming data of social platforms. We illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach with a real-world dataset of 4M tweets with more than 1000 rumours.","['Bela Stantic', 'Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung', 'Hongzhi Yin', 'Bolong Zheng', 'Matthias Weidlich', 'Nguyen Thanh Tam']",10.14778/3329772.3329778,http://dx.doi.org/10.14778/3329772.3329778,5,2019,From anomaly detection to rumour detection using data streams of social platforms,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,"([],)",,Information Science

"Data are the infrastructure of science and they serve as the groundwork for scientific pursuits. Data publication has emerged as a game-changing breakthrough in scholarly communication. Data form the outputs of research but also are a gateway to new hypotheses, enabling new scientific insights and driving innovation. And yet stakeholders across the scholarly ecosystem, including practitioners, institutions, and funders of scientific research are increasingly concerned about the lack of sharing and reuse of research data. Across disciplines and countries, researchers, funders, and publishers are pushing for a more effective research environment, minimizing the duplication of work and maximizing the interaction between researchers. Availability, discoverability, and reproducibility of research outputs are key factors to support data reuse and make possible this new environment of highly collaborative research. An interoperable e-infrastructure is imperative in order to develop new platforms and services for to data publication and reuse. DataCite has been working to establish and promote methods to locate, identify and share information about research data. Along with service development, DataCite supports and advocates for the standards behind persistent identifiers (in particular DOIs, Digital Object Identifiers) for data and other research outputs. Persistent identifiers allow different platforms to exchange information consistently and unambiguously and provide a reliable way to track citations and reuse. Because of this, data publication can become a reality from a technical standpoint, but the adoption of data publication and data citation as a practice by researchers is still in its early stages. Since 2009, DataCite has been developing a series of tools and services to foster the adoption of data publication and citation among the research community. Through the years, DataCite has worked in a close collaboration with interdisciplinary partners on these issues and we have gained insight into the development of data publication workflows. This paper describes the types of different actions and the lessons learned by DataCite.","['Patricia Cruse', 'Martin Fenner', 'Laura Rueda']",10.2218/ijdc.v11i2.421,http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v11i2.421,7,2017,DataCite: Lessons Learned on Persistent Identifiers for Research Data,International Journal of Digital Curation,"([],)",,Information Science

"Automatic keyphrase extraction techniques aim to extract quality keyphrases for higher level summarization of a document. Majority of the existing techniques are mainly domain-specific, which require application domain knowledge and employ higher order statistical methods, and computationally expensive and require large train data, which is rare for many applications. Overcoming these issues, this paper proposes a new unsupervised keyphrase extraction technique. The proposed unsupervised keyphrase extraction technique, named TeKET or Tree-based Keyphrase Extraction Technique, is a domain-independent technique that employs limited statistical knowledge and requires no train data. This technique also introduces a new variant of a binary tree, called KeyPhrase Extraction (KePhEx) tree, to extract final keyphrases from candidate keyphrases. In addition, a measure, called Cohesiveness Index or CI, is derived which denotes a given node’s degree of cohesiveness with respect to the root. The CI is used in flexibly extracting final keyphrases from the KePhEx tree and is co-utilized in the ranking process. The effectiveness of the proposed technique and its domain and language independence are experimentally evaluated using available benchmark corpora, namely SemEval-2010 (a scientific articles dataset), Theses100 (a thesis dataset), and a German Research Article dataset, respectively. The acquired results are compared with other relevant unsupervised techniques belonging to both statistical and graph-based techniques. The obtained results demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed technique over other compared techniques in terms of precision, recall, and F1 scores.","['Mohammed Mostafizur Rahman', 'Kamal Z.

"SummaryThe past few weeks have witnessed a worldwide mobilization of the research community in response to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). This global response has led to a burst of publications on the pathophysiology of the virus, yet without coordinated efforts to organize this knowledge, it can remain hidden away from individual research groups. By extracting and formalizing this knowledge in a structured and computable form, as in the form of a knowledge graph, researchers can readily reason and analyze this information on a much larger scale.

"An ongoing project explores the extent to which artificial intelligence (AI), specifically in the areas of natural language processing and semantic reasoning, can be exploited to facilitate the studies of science by deploying software agents equipped with natural language understanding capabilities to read scholarly publications on the web. The knowledge extracted by these AI agents is organized into a heterogeneous graph, called Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG), where the nodes and the edges represent the entities engaging in scholarly communications and the relationships among them, respectively. The frequently updated data set and a few software tools central to the underlying AI components are distributed under an open data license for research and commercial applications. This paper describes the design, schema, and technical and business motivations behind MAG and elaborates how MAG can be used in analytics, search, and recommendation scenarios. How AI plays an important role in avoiding various biases and human induced errors in other data sets and how the technologies can be further improved in the future are also discussed.","['Kanakia Anshul', 'Dong Yuxiao', 'Wu Chieh-Han', 'Huang Chi-Yuan', 'Shen Zhihong', 'Wang Kuansan']",10.1162/qss_a_00021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00021,0,0,Microsoft Academic Graph: When experts are not enough,['Quantitative Science Studies'],"([],)",,Information Science

"Hundreds of years of biodiversity research have resulted in the accumulation of a substantial pool of communal knowledge; however, most of it is stored in silos isolated from each other, such as published articles or monographs. The need for a system to store and manage collective biodiversity knowledge in a community-agreed and interoperable open format has evolved into the concept of the Open Biodiversity Knowledge Management System (OBKMS). This paper presents OpenBiodiv: An OBKMS that utilizes semantic publishing workflows, text and data mining, common standards, ontology modelling and graph database technologies to establish a robust infrastructure for managing biodiversity knowledge. It is presented as a Linked Open Dataset generated from scientific literature. OpenBiodiv encompasses data extracted from more than 5000 scholarly articles published by Pensoft and many more taxonomic treatments extracted by Plazi from journals of other publishers. The data from both sources are converted to Resource Description Framework (RDF) and integrated in a graph database using the OpenBiodiv-O ontology and an RDF version of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) taxonomic backbone. Through the application of semantic technologies, the project showcases the value of open publishing of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) data towards the establishment of open science practices in the biodiversity domain.","['Simov Kiril', 'Stoev Pavel', 'Georgiev Teodor', 'Zhelezov Georgi', 'Senderov Viktor', 'Dimitrova Mariya', '{Penev Lyubomir']",10.3390/publications7020038,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/publications7020038,0,0,OpenBiodiv: A Knowledge Graph for Literature-Extracted Linked Open Data in Biodiversity Science,['Publications'],"(['Computer Science Applications', 'Media Technology', 'Communication', 'Business and International Management', 'Library and Information Sciences'],)",,Information Science
"Summary                  The COVID-19 crisis has elicited a global response by the scientific community that has led to a burst of publications on the pathophysiology of the virus. However, without coordinated efforts to organize this knowledge, it can remain hidden away from individual research groups. By extracting and formalizing this knowledge in a structured and computable form, as in the form of a knowledge graph, researchers can readily reason and analyze this information on a much larger scale. Here, we present the COVID-19 Knowledge Graph, an expansive cause-and-effect network constructed from scientific literature on the new coronavirus that aims to provide a comprehensive view of its pathophysiology. To make this resource available to the research community and facilitate its exploration and analysis, we also implemented a web application and released the KG in multiple standard formats.

"Since its inception in 2007, DBpedia has been constantly releasing open data in RDF, extracted from various Wikimedia projects using a complex software system called the DBpedia Information Extraction Framework (DIEF). For the past 12 years, the software received a plethora of extensions by the community, which positively affected the size and data quality. Due to the increase in size and complexity, the release process was facing huge delays (from 12 to 17 months cycle), thus impacting the agility of the development. In this paper, we describe the new DBpedia release cycle including our innovative release workflow, which allows development teams (in particular those who publish large, open data) to implement agile, cost-efficient processes and scale up productivity. The DBpedia release workflow has been re-engineered, its new primary focus is on productivity and agility, to address the challenges of size and complexity. At the same time, quality is assured by implementing a comprehensive testing methodology. We run an experimental evaluation and argue that the implemented measures increase agility and allow for cost-effective quality-control and debugging and thus achieve a higher level of maintainability. As a result, DBpedia now publishes regular (i.e. monthly) releases with over 21 billion triples with minimal publishing effort.","['Johannes Frey', 'Milan Dojchinovski', 'Sebastian Hellmann', 'Marvin Hofer']",10.1007/978-3-030-59833-4_1,https://svn.aksw.org/papers/2020/semantics_marvin/public.pdf,0,2020,The New DBpedia Release Cycle: Increasing Agility and Efficiency in Knowledge Extraction Workflows,Semantic Systems.

"&#x0D;&#x0D;Objective – Evidence from systematic reviews a decade ago suggested that face-to-face and online methods to provide information literacy training in universities were equally effective in terms of skills learnt, but there was a lack of robust comparative research. The objectives of this review were (1) to update these findings with the inclusion of more recent primary research; (2) to further enhance the summary of existing evidence by including studies of blended formats (with components of both online and face-to-face teaching) compared to single format education; and (3) to explore student views on the various formats employed.&#x0D;&#x0D;Methods – Authors searched seven databases along with a range of supplementary search methods to identify comparative research studies, dated January 1995 to October 2016, exploring skill outcomes for students enrolled in higher education programs. There were 33 studies included, of which 19 also contained comparative data on student views. Where feasible, meta-analyses were carried out to provide summary estimates of skills development and a thematic analysis was completed to identify student views across the different formats.&#x0D;&#x0D;Results – A large majority of studies (27 of 33; 82%) found no statistically significant difference between formats in skills outcomes for students. Of 13 studies that could be included in a meta-analysis, the standardized mean difference (SMD) between skill test results for face-to-face versus online formats was -0.01 (95% confidence interval -0.28 to 0.26). Of ten studies comparing blended to single delivery format, seven (70%) found no statistically significant difference between formats, and the remaining studies had mixed outcomes. From the limited evidence available across all studies, there is a potential dichotomy between outcomes measured via skill test and assignment (course work) which is worthy of further investigation. The thematic analysis of student views found no preference in relation to format on a range of measures in 14 of 19 studies (74%). The remainder identified that students perceived advantages and disadvantages for each format but had no overall preference.&#x0D;&#x0D;Conclusions – There is compelling evidence that information literacy training is effective and well received across a range of delivery formats. Further research looking at blended versus single format methods, and the time implications for each, as well as comparing assignment to skill test outcomes would be valuable. Future studies should adopt a methodologically robust design (such as the randomized controlled trial) with a large student population and validated outcome measures.","['Gillian Hallam', 'Heather Strange', 'Delyth Morris', 'Damian Farnell', 'Alison Lesley Weightman']",10.18438/b86w90,http://dx.doi.org/10.18438/b86w90,9,2017,"A Systematic Review of Information Literacy Programs in Higher Education: Effects of Face-to-Face, Online, and Blended Formats on Student Skills and Views",Evidence Based Library and Information Practice,"(['Library and Information Sciences'],)",,Information Science

"Named entity recognition has served many natural language processing tasks such as information retrieval, machine translation, and question answering systems. Many researchers have addressed the name identification issue in a variety of languages and recently some research efforts have started to focus on named entity recognition for the Arabic language. We present a working Arabic information extraction (IE) system that is used to analyze large volumes of news texts every day to extract the named entity (NE) types person, organization, location, date, and number, as well as quotations (direct reported speech) by and about people. The named entity recognition (NER) system was not developed for Arabic, but instead a multilingual NER system was adapted to also cover Arabic. The Semitic language Arabic substantially differs from the Indo-European and Finno-Ugric languages currently covered. This article thus describes what Arabic language-specific resources had to be developed and what changes needed to be made to the rule set in order to be applicable to the Arabic language. The achieved evaluation results are generally satisfactory, but could be improved for certain entity types.",W.

"Academic data management has become an increasingly challenging task as research evolves over time. Essential tasks such as information retrieval and research networking have turned into extremely difficult operations due to an ever-growing number of researchers and scientific articles. Numerous initiatives have emerged in the IT environments to address this issue, especially focused on web technologies. Although those approaches have individually provided solutions for diverse problems, they still can not offer integrated knowledge bases nor flexibility to exploit adequately this information. In this article, we present REDI, a Linked Data-powered framework for academic knowledge management and research networking, which introduces a new perspective of integration. REDI combines information from multiple sources into a consolidated knowledge base through state-of-the-art procedures and leverages semantic web standards to represent the information. Moreover, REDI takes advantage of such knowledge for data visualisation and analysis, which ultimately improves and simplifies many activities including research networking.","['Víctor Saquicela', 'Boris Villazon-Terrazas', 'José Segarra', 'José Ortiz Vivar']",10.1177/0165551520944351,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0165551520944351,8,2020,REDI: Towards knowledge graph-powered scholarly information management and research networking,Journal of Information Science,"(['Library and Information Sciences', 'Information Systems'],)",,Information Science

"The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.","['Illia Polosukhin', 'Lukasz Kaiser', 'Aidan N Gomez', 'Llion Jones', 'Jakob Uszkoreit', 'Niki Parmar', 'Noam Shazeer', 'Ashish Vaswani']",,,0,2017,Attention Is All You Need,arXiv preprint arXiv:1706.03762,,Computer Science,Information Science

"DOI: 10.12685/027.7-2-1-48The last ten years have shown, that Open Access is not only a vision, but has become real. Libraries are in a good position to push Open Access even further, as they currently fully pay the production costs of the traditional subscription model.

"Hundreds of years of biodiversity research have resulted in the accumulation of a substantial pool of communal knowledge; however, most of it is stored in silos isolated from each other, such as published articles or monographs. The need for a system to store and manage collective biodiversity knowledge in a community-agreed and interoperable open format has evolved into the concept of the Open Biodiversity Knowledge Management System (OBKMS). This paper presents OpenBiodiv: An OBKMS that utilizes semantic publishing workflows, text and data mining, common standards, ontology modelling and graph database technologies to establish a robust infrastructure for managing biodiversity knowledge. It is presented as a Linked Open Dataset generated from scientific literature. OpenBiodiv encompasses data extracted from more than 5000 scholarly articles published by Pensoft and many more taxonomic treatments extracted by Plazi from journals of other publishers. The data from both sources are converted to Resource Description Framework (RDF) and integrated in a graph database using the OpenBiodiv-O ontology and an RDF version of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) taxonomic backbone. Through the application of semantic technologies, the project showcases the value of open publishing of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) data towards the establishment of open science practices in the biodiversity domain.","['Lyubomir Penev', 'Teodor Georgiev', 'Pavel Stoev', 'Georgi Zhelezov', 'Viktor Senderov', 'Kiril Simov', 'Mariya Dimitrova']",10.3390/publications7020038,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/publications7020038,5,2019,OpenBiodiv: A Knowledge Graph for Literature-Extracted Linked Open Data in Biodiversity Science,['Publications'],"(['Computer Science Applications', 'Media Technology', 'Communication', 'Business and International Management', 'Library and Information Sciences'],)",,Information Science

"Motivated by evolving business requirements and novel enterprise applications, we propose and implement the Semantic Master Data Management (SMDM), a semantics-level enhancement to the existing MDM solutions. The SMDM system publishes relational-based master data as virtual RDF store, and injects instantaneous reasoning capabilities into semantic queries. Two kinds of ontologies are introduced to the system, the core MDM ontology and the external imported domain ontology. SMDM enables data linking among multi-domains, implicit relationship discovery, and declarative definition and extension of business policies and entities. Based on these functions, modern companies can customize their applications and services on demand within the MDM hub. In the demonstration, we build the system environment based on IBM's MDM solution, and run the use cases on the master data of an insurance company.","['Yong Yu', 'Yue Pan', 'Kang Zhang', 'Nick Kanellos', 'Li Ma', 'Feng Cao', 'Xingzhi Sun', 'Xiaoyuan Wang']",10.14778/1687553.1687600,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/36fa0be693b4cbe13dc802679d5f9af5c89b2eb3,0,2009,SMDM: enhancing enterprise-wide master data management using semantic web technologies,Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,,['Computer Science'],Information Science

"A high quality of master data is vital for process automation and IS support in enterprises. Retailers and manufacturers have started improving their master data quality on a syntactical level. Many researchers address problems of syntactical master data quality (e.g. missing values, typo errors), but only few approaches target semantic issues of master data quality management. Poor semantic data quality can lead to a misalignment between real-world phenomena and data stored in the databases. Furthermore, semantic data quality relies on the current use of data, but is not limited to the present use of the data and its impact on existing business processes. In fact it includes the likely future uses of the data as well. In this paper, we discuss the contribution of ontologies for identifying and assessing semantic master data quality problems. We develop a conceptual approach and procedure model for addressing the semantic master data quality problem. The method is applied within a scenario for automated coupon clearing in the retail industry.

"Product-related information can be found in various data sources and formats across the product lifecycle. Effectively exploiting this information requires the federation of these sources, the extraction of implicit information, and the efficient access to this comprehensive knowledge base. Existing solutions for product information management (PIM) are usually restricted to structured information, but most of the business-critical information resides in unstructured documents. We present a generic architecture for federating heterogeneous information from various sources, including the Internet of Things, and argue how this process benefits from using semantic representations. A reference implementation tailor-made to business users is explained and evaluated. We also discuss several issues we experienced that we believe to be valuable for researchers and implementers of semantic information systems, as well as the information retrieval community.","['Till Riedel', 'Markus Aleksy', 'Andreas Konzag', 'Daniel Schuster', 'Johannes Meinecke', 'Matthias Wauer']",10.4018/978-1-4666-2026-1.ch008,http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/978-1-4666-2026-1.ch008,0,2011,Semantic federation of product information from structured and unstructured sources,International Journal of Business Data Communications and Networking (IJBDCN),"([],)",,Information Science

"Information organizing principle is one of the key issues of intelligent master model (IMM), which is an enhancement of the master model (MM) based on KBE (knowledge-based engineering). Despite the fact that the core product model (CPM) has been confirmed to be an organizing mechanism for product master model, the key issue of supporting the information organizing for IMM is not yet well addressed, mainly due to the following two reasons; (1) lack of representation of complete information and knowledge with regard to product and process, including the know-why, know-how, and know-what information and knowledge, and (2) lack of semantic richness. Therefore, a multiaspect extension to CPM was first defined, and then an ontology was constructed to represent the information and design knowledge. The extension refers to adding a design process model, context model, product control structure model, and design rationale model to CPM concerning the enhancement of master model, which is to comprehensively represent the reason, process, and result information and knowledge of theproduct. The ontology construction refers to representing the concepts, relationships among these concepts and consistency rules of IMM information structure. Finally, an example of barrel design and analysis process is illustrated to verify the effectiveness of proposed method.","['Wu Lv', 'Yan Yan', 'Shahid I Butt', 'Fa-ping Zhang', 'Cong Yu']",10.3390/app9122553,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app9122553,0,2019,OntoIMM: An Ontology for Product Intelligent Master Model,Applied Sciences,"(['Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes', 'Computer Science Applications', 'Process Chemistry and Technology', 'General Engineering', 'Instrumentation', 'General Materials Science'],)",,Information Science

SpanBERT consistently outperforms BERT and our better-tuned baselines, with substantial gains on span selection tasks such as question answering and coreference resolution. In particular, with the same training data and model size as BERTlarge, our single model obtains 94.6% and 88.7% F1 on SQuAD 1.1 and 2.0 respectively.

"Current state-of-the-art relation extraction methods typically rely on a set of lexical, syntactic, and semantic features, explicitly computed in a pre-processing step. Training feature extraction models requires additional annotated language resources, which severely restricts the applicability and portability of relation extraction to novel languages. Similarly, pre-processing introduces an additional source of error. To address these limitations, we introduce TRE, a Transformer for Relation Extraction, extending the OpenAI Generative Pre-trained Transformer [Radford et al., 2018]. Unlike previous relation extraction models, TRE uses pre-trained deep language representations instead of explicit linguistic features to inform the relation classification and combines it with the self-attentive Transformer architecture to effectively model long-range dependencies between entity mentions. TRE allows us to learn implicit linguistic features solely from plain text corpora by unsupervised pre-training, before fine-tuning the learned language representations on the relation extraction task. TRE obtains a new state-of-the-art result on the TACRED and SemEval 2010 Task 8 datasets, achieving a test F1 of 67.4 and 87.1, respectively. Furthermore, we observe a significant increase in sample efficiency. With only 20% of the training examples, TRE matches the performance of our baselines and our model trained from scratch on 100% of the TACRED dataset. We open-source our trained models, experiments, and source code.","['Leonhard Hennig', 'Marc Hübner', 'Christoph Alt']",10.24432/C5KW2W,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/28f3a20ebd5e2f3afa871b1784076cf7004415b8,0,2019,Improving relation extraction by pre-trained language representations,arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.03088,,['Computer Science'],Information Science
"Motivation                  Biomedical text mining is becoming increasingly important as the number of biomedical documents rapidly grows. With the progress in natural language processing (NLP), extracting valuable information from biomedical literature has gained popularity among researchers, and deep learning has boosted the development of effective biomedical text mining models. However, directly applying the advancements in NLP to biomedical text mining often yields unsatisfactory results due to a word distribution shift from general domain corpora to biomedical corpora. In this article, we investigate how the recently introduced pre-trained language model BERT can be adapted for biomedical corpora.                                                Results                  We introduce BioBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining), which is a domain-specific language representation model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical corpora. With almost the same architecture across tasks, BioBERT largely outperforms BERT and previous state-of-the-art models in a variety of biomedical text mining tasks when pre-trained on biomedical corpora. While BERT obtains performance comparable to that of previous state-of-the-art models, BioBERT significantly outperforms them on the following three representative biomedical text mining tasks: biomedical named entity recognition (0.62% F1 score improvement), biomedical relation extraction (2.80% F1 score improvement) and biomedical question answering (12.24% MRR improvement). Our analysis results show that pre-training BERT on biomedical corpora helps it to understand complex biomedical texts.

"Classifying semantic relations between entity pairs in sentences is an important task in natural language processing (NLP). Most previous models applied to relation classification rely on high-level lexical and syntactic features obtained by NLP tools such as WordNet, the dependency parser, part-of-speech (POS) tagger, and named entity recognizers (NER). In addition, state-of-the-art neural models based on attention mechanisms do not fully utilize information related to the entity, which may be the most crucial feature for relation classification. To address these issues, we propose a novel end-to-end recurrent neural model that incorporates an entity-aware attention mechanism with a latent entity typing (LET) method. Our model not only effectively utilizes entities and their latent types as features, but also builds word representations by applying self-attention based on symmetrical similarity of a sentence itself. Moreover, the model is interpretable by visualizing applied attention mechanisms. Experimental results obtained with the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset, which is one of the most popular relation classification tasks, demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models without any high-level features.","['Yong Suk Choi', 'Sangwoo Seo', 'Joohong Lee']",10.3390/sym11060785,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym11060785,0,2019,Semantic relation classification via bidirectional LSTM networks with entity-aware attention using latent entity typing,Symmetry,"(['Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)', 'General Mathematics', 'Chemistry (miscellaneous)', 'Computer Science (miscellaneous)'],)",,Information Science

"In recent times, polymer-based flexible pressure sensors have been attracting a lot of attention because of their various applications. A highly sensitive and flexible sensor is suggested, capable of being attached to the human body, based on a three-dimensional dielectric elastomeric structure of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and microsphere composite. This sensor has maximal porosity due to macropores created by sacrificial layer grains and micropores generated by microspheres pre-mixed with PDMS, allowing it to operate at a wider pressure range (~150 kPa) while maintaining a sensitivity (of 0.124 kPa−1 in a range of 0~15 kPa) better than in previous studies. The maximized pores can cause deformation in the structure, allowing for the detection of small changes in pressure. In addition to exhibiting a fast rise time (~167 ms) and fall time (~117 ms), as well as excellent reproducibility, the fabricated pressure sensor exhibits reliability in its response to repeated mechanical stimuli (2.5 kPa, 1000 cycles). As an application, we develop a wearable device for monitoring repeated tiny motions, such as the pulse on the human neck and swallowing at the Adam’s apple. This sensory device is also used to detect movements in the index finger and to monitor an insole system in real-time.","['Hanchul Cho', 'Jongsoo Ko', 'Jinhyoung Park', 'Byunggeon Park', 'Kyungkuk Jung', 'Wookjin Lee', 'Young Jung']",10.3390/polym12061412,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/polym12061412,6,2020,A Highly Sensitive and Flexible Capacitive Pressure Sensor Based on a Porous Three-Dimensional PDMS/Microsphere Composite,Polymers,"(['Polymers and Plastics', 'General Chemistry'],)",,Nanoscience and Nanotechnology

"The chance to win a football match can be significantly increased if the right tactic is chosen and the behavior of the opposite team is well anticipated. For this reason, every professional football club employs a team of game analysts. However, at present game performance analysis is done manually and therefore highly time-consuming. Consequently, automated tools to support the analysis process are required. In this context, one of the main tasks is to summarize team formations by patterns such as 4-4-2 that can give insights into tactical instructions and patterns. In this paper, we introduce an analytics approach that automatically classifies and visualizes the team formation based on the players' position data. We focus on single match situations instead of complete halftimes or matches to provide a more detailed analysis. %in contrast to previous work. The novel classification approach calculates the similarity based on pre-defined templates for different tactical formations. A detailed analysis of individual match situations depending on ball possession and match segment length is provided. For this purpose, a visual summary is utilized that summarizes the team formation in a match segment. An expert annotation study is conducted that demonstrates 1)~the complexity of the task and 2)~the usefulness of the visualization of single situations to understand team formations. The suggested classification approach outperforms existing methods for formation classification. In particular, our approach gives insights into the shortcomings of using patterns like 4-4-2 to describe team formations.","['Ralph Ewerth', 'Robert Rein', 'Jonas Theiner', 'Eric Müller-Budack']",10.1145/3347318.3355527,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f402bf9019a7c98780b4dd4606d7d298f224d4ed,0,2019,""" Does 4-4-2 exist?""– An Analytics Approach to Understand and Classify Football Team Formations in Single Match Situations",Proceedings Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Multimedia Content Analysis in Sports,,['Computer Science'],Social and Behavioral Sciences

"Previous research on the relationship between students’ home and school Information and Communication Technology (ICT) resources and academic performance has shown ambiguous results. The availability of ICT resources at school has been found to be unrelated or negatively related to academic performance, whereas the availability of ICT resources at home has been found to be both positively and negatively related to academic performance. In addition, the frequency of use of ICT is related to students’ academic achievement. This relationship has been found to be negative for ICT use at school, however, for ICT use at home the literature on the relationship with academic performance is again ambiguous. In addition to ICT availability and ICT use, students’ attitudes towards ICT have also been found to play a role in student performance. In the present study, we examine how availability of ICT resources, students’ use of those resources (at school, outside school for schoolwork, outside school for leisure), and students’ attitudes toward ICT (interest in ICT, perceived ICT competence, perceived ICT autonomy) relate to individual differences in performance on a digital assessment of reading in one comprehensive model using the Dutch PISA 2015 sample of 5183 15-year-olds (49.2% male). Student gender and students’ economic, social, and cultural status accounted for a substantial part of the variation in digitally assessed reading performance. Controlling for these relationships, results indicated that students with moderate access to ICT resources, moderate use of ICT at school or outside school for schoolwork, and moderate interest in ICT had the highest digitally assessed reading performance. In contrast, students who reported moderate competence in ICT had the lowest digitally assessed reading performance. In addition, frequent use of ICT outside school for leisure was negatively related to digitally assessed reading performance, whereas perceived autonomy was positively related. Taken together, the findings suggest that excessive access to ICT resources, excessive use of ICT, and excessive interest in ICT is associated with lower digitally assessed reading performance.","['Margriet A.

"As a relevant cognitive-motivational aspect of ICT literacy, a new construct ICT Engagement is theoretically based on self-determination theory and involves the factors ICT interest, Perceived ICT competence, Perceived autonomy related to ICT use, and ICT as a topic in social interaction. In this manuscript, we present different sources of validity supporting the construct interpretation of test scores in the ICT Engagement scale, which was used in PISA 2015. Specifically, we investigated the internal structure by dimensional analyses and investigated the relation of ICT Engagement aspects to other variables. The analyses are based on public data from PISA 2015 main study from Switzerland (n = 5860) and Germany (n = 6504). First, we could confirm the four-dimensional structure of ICT Engagement for the Swiss sample using a structural equation modelling approach. Second, ICT Engagement scales explained the highest amount of variance in ICT Use for Entertainment, followed by Practical use. Third, we found significantly lower values for girls in all ICT Engagement scales except ICT Interest. Fourth, we found a small negative correlation between the scores in the subscale “ICT as a topic in social interaction” and reading performance in PISA 2015. We could replicate most results for the German sample. Overall, the obtained results support the construct interpretation of the four ICT Engagement subscales.","['Frank Goldhammer', 'Olga Kunina-Habenicht']",10.1186/s40536-020-00084-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40536-020-00084-z,4,2020,ICT Engagement: a new construct and its assessment in PISA 2015,Large-scale Assessments in Education,"(['Education'],)",,Social and Behavioral Sciences
"The aim of the present study is twofold: (1) to identify a factor structure between variables-interest in broad science topics, perceived information and communications technology (ICT) competence, environmental awareness and optimism; and (2) to explore the relations between these variables at the country level. The first part of the aim is addressed using exploratory factor analysis with data from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) for 15-year-old students from Singapore and Finland. The results show that a comparable structure with four factors was verified in both countries. Correlation analyses and linear regression were used to address the second part of the aim. The results show that adolescents’ interest in broad science topics can predict perceived ICT competence. Their interest in broad science topics and perceived ICT competence can predict environmental awareness in both countries. However, there is difference in predicting environmental optimism. Singaporean students’ interest in broad science topics and their perceived ICT competences are positive predictors, whereas environmental awareness is a negative predictor. Finnish students’ environmental awareness negatively predicted environmental optimism.","['Morris Siu-Yung Jong', 'Ching Sing Chai', 'Pei-Yi Lin']",10.3390/ijerph16245157,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16245157,12,2019,"A PISA-2015 Comparative Meta-Analysis between Singapore and Finland: Relations of Students’ Interest in Science, Perceived ICT Competence, and Environmental Awareness and Optimism",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"(['Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health'],)",,Social and Behavioral Sciences

"(1) Background: Although bullying victimization is a phenomenon that is increasingly being recognized as a public health and mental health concern in many countries, research attention on this aspect of youth violence in low- and middle-income countries, especially sub-Saharan Africa, is minimal. The current study examined the national prevalence of bullying victimization and its correlates among in-school adolescents in Ghana. (2) Methods: A sample of 1342 in-school adolescents in Ghana (55.2% males; 44.8% females) aged 12–18 was drawn from the 2012 Global School-based Health Survey (GSHS) for the analysis. Self-reported bullying victimization “during the last 30 days, on how many days were you bullied?” was used as the central criterion variable. Three-level analyses using descriptive, Pearson chi-square, and binary logistic regression were performed. Results of the regression analysis were presented as adjusted odds ratios (aOR) at 95% confidence intervals (CIs), with a statistical significance pegged at p &lt; 0.05. (3) Results: Bullying victimization was prevalent among 41.3% of the in-school adolescents. Pattern of results indicates that adolescents in SHS 3 [aOR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.25, 0.47] and SHS 4 [aOR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.21, 0.44] were less likely to be victims of bullying. Adolescents who had sustained injury [aOR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.63, 2.73] were more likely to be bullied compared to those who had not sustained any injury. The odds of bullying victimization were higher among adolescents who had engaged in physical fight [aOR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.42, 2.25] and those who had been physically attacked [aOR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.32, 2.27]. Similarly, adolescents who felt lonely were more likely to report being bullied [aOR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.08, 2.08] as against those who did not feel lonely. Additionally, adolescents with a history of suicide attempts were more likely to be bullied [aOR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.11, 2.38] and those who used marijuana had higher odds of bullying victimization [aOR = 3.36, 95% CI = 1.10, 10.24]. (4) Conclusions: Current findings require the need for policy makers and school authorities in Ghana to design and implement policies and anti-bullying interventions (e.g., Social Emotional Learning (SEL), Emotive Behavioral Education (REBE), Marijuana Cessation Therapy (MCT)) focused on addressing behavioral issues, mental health and substance abuse among in-school adolescents.","['Bright Opoku Ahinkorah', 'Abdul Cadri', 'Joshua Okyere', 'James Boadu Frimpong', 'John Elvis Hagan', 'Abdul-Aziz Seidu', 'Richard Gyan Aboagye']",10.3390/healthcare9030292,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9030292,3,2021,Bullying Victimization among In-School Adolescents in Ghana: Analysis of Prevalence and Correlates from the Global School-Based Health Survey,Healthcare,"([],)",,Social and Behavioral Sciences

"Providing of sustainability is one of the main priorities in normative documents in various countries. Factors affecting regional competitiveness is seen as close to them determining sustainability in many researches. The aim of this research was to identify and evaluate main factors of competitiveness for statistical regions of Latvia to promote sustainable development of the country, applying the complex regional competitiveness assessment system developed by the author. The analysis of the Regional Competitiveness Index (RCI) and its sub-indexes showed that each statistical region has both: factors promoting and hindering competitiveness. Overall the most competitive is Riga statistical region, but the last place takes Latgale statistical region. It is possible to promote equal regional development and sustainability of Latvia by implementing well-developed regional development strategy and National Action Plan. To develop such strategies, it is necessary to understand the concept of sustainable competitiveness. To evaluate sustainable competitiveness of Latvia and its regions it is necessary to develop further the methodology of regional competitiveness evaluation.",Ilze Judrupa,10.14207/ejsd.2021.v10n1p650,file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/1198-Article%20Text-2347-1-10-20210130_Regional%20sustainability_Latvia_02.pdf,2,2021,Regional Competitiveness as an Aspect Promoting Sustainability of Latvia,European Journal of Sustainable Development,"(['Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Environmental Science (miscellaneous)', 'Development', 'Geography, Planning and Development'],)",,Economics
"Sustainable urbanization is a challenge to human beings in the modern era of technology. Cities all over the world are facing several problems due to urbanization and industrialization. Urban problems could be assessed through development of indices of urban sustainability on the basis of its three dimensions: environment, economics and social. The present study was conducted to identify indicators to develop indices for assessment of sustainability in some populated cities of Punjab. The study focused on the indicators based on environmental, economic and social development to develop a rational indicator system on the basis of secondary data collected from 2004 to 2014. A total of 40 indicators were identified to assess the urban sustainability progress in Lahore, Rawalpindi, Multan, Gujranwala and Faisalabad cities. The result of the sub-indices indicated that poor performance was evident in the environmental sector, rather than in the economic and social sectors. The cities scored between 0.27 and 0.58 in environmental dimensions, showing a decreasing trend from 2004 to 2014. The declining trend of indices was due to population influx, rapid urbanization, reduction in green areas, industrialization, high level of atmospheric and water pollutants. In case of the economic sector, an increasing trend was observed which indicates the gradual improvement in living standards of people. In the social dimensions of the indicator system, less variations were observed among the cities and ranged between 0.49 and 0.58. Overall, the results of the urban sustainability index showed score was ranges between 0.41 to 0.52. None of the Punjab cities attained the position as a sustainable city (0.75) Lahore (0.52) and Faisalabad (0.52) were ranked as moderately sustainable cities, whereas, Rawalpindi (0.48), Gujranwala (0.47) and Multan (0.41) were ranked as weak sustainable cities. The study highlighted that the urban sustainability indicator system could be useful to determine the existing sustainability in cities of the developing countries for better resource management practices.","['Sajid Ahmad', 'Abdul Qadir', 'Ambreen Ghalib']",10.3390/su9081473,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/9/8/1473,7,2017,"Evaluation of Developmental Progress in Some Cities of Punjab, Pakistan, Using Urban Sustainability Indicators",Sustainability,"(['Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Geography, Planning and Development'],)",,Economics

"The 1990 World Development Report from the World Bank defined the “extremely poor” people of the world as those who are currently living on no more than $1 per day per person. But how actually does one live on less than $1 per day? This essay is about the economic lives of the extremely poor: the choices they face, the constraints they grapple with, and the challenges they meet. A number of recent data sets and a body of new research allow us to start building an image of the way the extremely poor live their lives. Our discussion builds on household surveys conducted in 13 countries: Cote d'Ivoire, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru, South Africa, Tanzania, and Timor Leste (East Timor). These surveys provide detailed information on extremely poor households around the world, from Asia to Africa to Latin America, including information on what they consume, where they work, and how they save and borrow. We consider the extremely poor—those living in households where the consumption per capita is less than $1.08 per person per day—as well as the merely “poor”—defined as those who live under $2.16 a day—using 1993 purchasing power parity as benchmark. In keeping with convention, we call these the $1 and $2 dollar poverty lines, respectively.","['Esther Duflo', 'Abhijit V Banerjee']",10.1257/jep.21.1.141,http://dx.doi.org/10.1257/jep.21.1.141,1,2007,The Economic Lives of the Poor,Journal of Economic Perspectives,"(['Economics and Econometrics', 'Economics and Econometrics'],)",,Behavioral Economics
"This paper situates the process of economic sustainability in the wider context of regional specialization and geographic concentration. The main object is to analyze the implications of increasing importance of sustainable development. In this context, the ICT (Information and Communication Technology) is at the same time a part of the problem and solution. The focus of this paper is also the ICT firms themselves. This research aimed to explore the ICT firms operating in the ICT sector and focused more on the ICT firms’ sustainability in connection with industry geographic concentration and regional specialization. The economic sustainability (evaluated by sustainability sub-index) and geographical and regional analysis were studied for 62 Computer Programming and 63 Information Services sub-divisions of the ICT sector. The results confirm a strong correlation between economic sustainability and firm geographic concentration. Results show that a worsening value of economic sustainability does not always lead to the worsening conditions in the industry and there is a strong relationship between the economic sustainability and regional analysis.","['Marek Valica', 'Tatiana Čorejova', 'Emilia Madudova']",10.3390/su10072511,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10072511,7,2018,Economic Sustainability in a Wider Context: Case Study of Considerable ICT Sector Sub-Divisions,Sustainability,"(['Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Geography, Planning and Development'],)",,Growth and Development

This paper aims to determine the spatial distribution of attractions in the administrative territories of Belgrade municipalities and to establish correlations with tourist attendance. The number and spatial distribution of accommodation capacities are the largest in the central city municipalities so that the number of visitors is the largest in them. At the same time, the central city municipalities have the highest concentration of tourist attractions. For data collection, the authors used field research, OSM (Open Street Maps), Google maps, with software processing ArcGIS 10.2.

"CDR (Call Detail Record) data are one type of mobile phone data collected by operators each time a user initiates/receives a phone call or sends/receives an sms. CDR data are a rich geo-referenced source of user behaviour information. In this work, we perform an analysis of CDR data for the city of Milan that originate from Telecom Italia Big Data Challenge. A set of graphs is generated from aggregated CDR data, where each node represents a centroid of an RBS (Radio Base Station) polygon, and each edge represents aggregated telecom traffic between two RBSs. To explore the community structure, we apply a modularity-based algorithm. Community structure between days is highly dynamic, with variations in number, size and spatial distribution. One general rule observed is that communities formed over the urban core of the city are small in size and prone to dynamic change in spatial distribution, while communities formed in the suburban areas are larger in size and more consistent with respect to their spatial distribution. To evaluate the dynamics of change in community structure between days, we introduced different graph based and spatial community properties which contain latent footprint of human dynamics. We created land use profiles for each RBS polygon based on the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service Urban Atlas data set to quantify the correlation and predictivennes of human dynamics properties based on land use. The results reveal a strong correlation between some properties and land use which motivated us to further explore this topic. The proposed methodology has been implemented in the programming language Scala inside the Apache Spark engine to support the most computationally intensive tasks and in Python using the rich portfolio of data analytics and machine learning libraries for the less demanding tasks.","['Apostolos N.

"Automatic keyphrase extraction techniques aim to extract quality keyphrases for higher level summarization of a document. Majority of the existing techniques are mainly domain-specific, which require application domain knowledge and employ higher order statistical methods, and computationally expensive and require large train data, which is rare for many applications. Overcoming these issues, this paper proposes a new unsupervised keyphrase extraction technique. The proposed unsupervised keyphrase extraction technique, named TeKET or Tree-based Keyphrase Extraction Technique, is a domain-independent technique that employs limited statistical knowledge and requires no train data. This technique also introduces a new variant of a binary tree, called KeyPhrase Extraction (KePhEx) tree, to extract final keyphrases from candidate keyphrases. In addition, a measure, called Cohesiveness Index or CI, is derived which denotes a given node’s degree of cohesiveness with respect to the root. The CI is used in flexibly extracting final keyphrases from the KePhEx tree and is co-utilized in the ranking process. The effectiveness of the proposed technique and its domain and language independence are experimentally evaluated using available benchmark corpora, namely SemEval-2010 (a scientific articles dataset), Theses100 (a thesis dataset), and a German Research Article dataset, respectively. The acquired results are compared with other relevant unsupervised techniques belonging to both statistical and graph-based techniques. The obtained results demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed technique over other compared techniques in terms of precision, recall, and F1 scores.","['Mohammed Mostafizur Rahman', 'Kamal Z.

"What is the effect of social distancing policies on the spread of the new coronavirus? Social distancing policies rose to prominence as most capable of containing contagion and saving lives. Our purpose in this paper is to identify the causal effect of social distancing policies on the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and on contagion velocity. We align our main argument with the existing scientific consensus: social distancing policies negatively affect the number of cases. To test this hypothesis, we construct a dataset with daily information on 78 affected countries in the world. We compute several relevant measures from publicly available information on the number of cases and deaths to estimate causal effects for short-term and cumulative effects of social distancing policies. We use a time-series cross-sectional matching approach to match countries’ observable histories. Causal effects (ATTs and ATEs) can be extracted via a dif-in-dif estimator. Results show that social distancing policies reduce the aggregated number of cases by 4,832 on average (or 17.5/100 thousand), but only when strict measures are adopted. This effect seems to manifest from the third week onwards.","['Marcus Torres', 'Virginia Rocha', 'Amanda Domingos', 'Matheus Cunha']",10.1590/0034-761220200530,http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/0034-761220200530,2,2021,How many could have been saved?

"This paper addresses the problem of low impact of smart city applications observed in the fields of energy and transport, which constitute high-priority domains for the development of smart cities. However, these are not the only fields where the impact of smart cities has been limited. The paper provides an explanation for the low impact of various individual applications of smart cities and discusses ways of improving their effectiveness. We argue that the impact of applications depends primarily on their ontology, and secondarily on smart technology and programming features. Consequently, we start by creating an overall ontology for the smart city, defining the building blocks of this ontology with respect to the most cited definitions of smart cities, and structuring this ontology with the Protégé 5.0 editor, defining entities, class hierarchy, object properties, and data type properties. We then analyze how the ontologies of a sample of smart city applications fit into the overall Smart City Ontology, the consistency between digital spaces, knowledge processes, city domains targeted by the applications, and the types of innovation that determine their impact. In conclusion, we underline the relationships between innovation and ontology, and discuss how we can improve the effectiveness of smart city applications, combining expert and user-driven ontology design with the integration and or-chestration of applications over platforms and larger city entities such as neighborhoods, districts, clusters, and sectors of city activities.","['Panagiotis Tsarchopoulos', 'Christina Kakderi', 'Charalampos Bratsas', 'Nicos Komninos']",10.18063/jsc.2015.01.001,https://www.udspub.com/ajj/public/index.php/jsc/article/view/54,11,2016,Smart City Ontologies: Improving the effectiveness of smart city applications,"['Journal of Smart Cities', 'Journal of Smart Cities', 'Journal of Smart Cities', 'Journal of Smart Cities']","([],)",,Urban Studies

". As many cities increase in size across multiple dimensions such as population, economic output and physical size, new methods for understanding and managing cities are required.

"Water scarcity in mountain regions such as the Himalaya has been studied with a pre-existing notion of scarcity justified by decades of communities' suffering from physical water shortages combined by difficulties of access. The Eastern Himalayan Region (EHR) of India receives significantly high amounts of annual precipitation. Studies have nonetheless shown that this region faces a strange dissonance: an acute water scarcity in a supposedly ‘water-rich’ region. The main objective of this paper is to decipher various drivers of water scarcity by locating the contemporary history of water institutions within the development trajectory of the Darjeeling region, particularly Darjeeling Municipal Town in West Bengal, India. A key feature of the region's urban water governance that defines the water scarcity narrative is the multiplicity of water institutions and the intertwining of formal and informal institutions at various scales. These factors affect the availability of and basic access to domestic water by communities in various ways resulting in the creation of a preferred water bundle consisting of informal water markets over and above traditional sourcing from springs and the formal water supply from the town municipality.","['Shrinivas Badiger', 'Rinan Shah']",10.2166/wp.2018.115,https://iwaponline.com/wp/article/22/S1/146/64261/Conundrum-or-paradox-deconstructing-the-spurious,10,2018,Conundrum or paradox: deconstructing the spurious case of water scarcity in the Himalayan Region through an institutional economics narrative,Water Policy,"(['Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Water Science and Technology', 'Geography, Planning and Development'],)",,Urban Studies

"This study examined the impact of Geese Theatre’s Re-Connect program on a sample of offenders who attended it. This program used theatre performance, experiential exercises, skills practice role-plays, and metaphors such as the masks to invite a group of offenders to consider and explore issues connected with their release and reconnecting with a life outside prison. Pre- and postprogram psychometric tests, behavior ratings, and interviews were completed to assess the effectiveness of the program. Significant changes were observed from pre- to posttreatment in terms of self-efficacy, motivation to change, and improved confidence in skills (i.e., social and friendship, occupational, family and intimacy, dealing with authority, alternatives to aggression or offending, and self-management and self-control skills). Improved behavior and engagement within the program was observed over the 3 days of the program. Interviews also revealed the positive impact the program had on the participants. This provides evidence supporting the short-term effectiveness of the Re-Connect program.","['A R Beech', 'A Watson', 'D Haskayne', 'C Pritchard', 'L Harkins']",10.1177/0306624X10370452,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0306624x10370452,1,2011,Evaluation of geese theatre's re-connect program: Addressing resettlement issues in prison,['International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology'],"(['Applied Psychology', 'Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)', 'Pathology and Forensic Medicine'],)",,Psychology

"In a phase I National Cancer Institute (NCI)-funded clinical trial, 34 breast cancer survivors, six weeks to one year post-treatment, were recruited to participate in a 6-class, 8-week long imagery stress reduction program entitled ""Envision the Rhythms of Life."" Patients practiced imagery during and between sessions. Outcomes for quality of life and cortisol rhythm were assessed pre- to post-intervention, in two subsets of survivors (intravenous [IV] chemotherapy, or no IV chemotherapy). Thirty survivors completed the 8-week program. Quality of life outcomes demonstrated statistically and clinically significant outcomes for the functional assessment of cancer therapy-general (FACT-G) global index (p<.001), representing improvements in survivor quality of life related to physical, social/family, emotional, and function well-being. Survivors also improved significantly on the breast cancer (p<.001) and spiritual subscales (p = .008.) Brief symptom inventory (BSI) assessment reported significant improvement for the global index (p<.001) which included the categories of depression, somatization and anxiety. At eight weeks, cortisol rhythm, a biochemical indicator of stress and likelihood of cancer recurrence, produced a trend toward improvement for the fifth time point of the day (p = .18). Likert-based stress scales showed highly significant reductions in stress (p<.0001) with subjects practicing imagery the most producing the best scores. Outcomes suggest the imagery program may significantly improve survivor quality of life and reduce stress.","['J L Palmer', 'J Link', 'R White', 'M Stewart', 'L Cohen', 'L Freeman']",10.2310/7200.2008.0011,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2a9e95033ab3f5919dd3abdfb61500ec97188d96,1,2008,Imagery intervention for recovering breast cancer patients: clinical trial of safety and efficacy,Journal of the Society for Integrative Oncology,,['Medicine'],Psychology
"Objective: To assess the effectiveness of cognitive-behavior (CB) group intervention versus relaxation and guided imagery (RGI) group training. Method: A total of 114 early-stage breast cancer patients were randomly assigned to CB, RGI, or control groups, and instruments were completed at pre- and postintervention and 4 months later. Results: Psychological distress was significantly reduced in both intervention groups compared to the control group. The RGI group was more effective in reducing levels of fatigue and sleep difficulties, whereas the CB group was more effective in reducing external health locus of control. Internal health locus of control did not significantly change. Adherence to self-practice at home was significantly associated with reduction in psychological and physical symptoms. Conclusions: The study supports the use of both CB and RGI models for reducing psychological distress in breast cancer patients. RGI showed advantages in reducing fatigue and improving sleep quality, whereas CB better reduced external health locus of control perceptions.","['G Fried', 'M Cohen']",10.1177/1049731506293741,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1049731506293741,1,2007,Comparing relaxation training and cognitive-behavioral group therapy for women with breast cancer,['Research on Social Work Practice'],"(['General Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Social Sciences (miscellaneous)'],)",,Psychology

"The paper will draw on ethnomusicological, cognitive and neuroscientific evidence in suggesting that music and language constitute complementary components of the human communicative toolkit. It will start by outlining an operational definition of music as a mode of social interaction in terms of its generic, cross-cultural properties that facilitates comparison with language as a universal human faculty. It will argue that, despite the fact that music appears much more heterogeneous and differentiated in function from culture to culture than does language, music possesses common attributes across cultures: it exploits the human capacity to entrain to external (particularly social) stimuli, and presents a rich set of semantic fields while under-determining meaning.  While language is held to possess both combinatoriality and semanticity, music is often claimed to be combinatorial but to lack semanticity. This paper will argue that music has semanticity, but that this semanticity is adapted for a different function from that of language. Music exploits the human capacity for entrainment, increasing the likelihood that participants will experience a sense of ‘shared intentionality’. It presents the characteristics of an ‘honest signal’ while under-specifying goals in ways that permit individuals to interact even while holding to personal interpretations of goals and meanings that may actually be in conflict. Music allows participants to explore the prospective consequences of their actions and attitudes towards others within a temporal framework that promotes the alignment of participants’ sense of goals. As a generic human faculty music thus provides a medium that is adapted to situations of social uncertainty, a medium by means of which a capacity for flexible social interaction can be explored and reinforced. It will be argued that a faculty for music is likely to have been exaptive in the evolution of the human capacity for complex social interaction.",Ian Cross,10.1177/1029864909013002091,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1029864909013002091,9,2009,The evolutionary nature of musical meaning,Musicae Scientiae,"(['Music', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology'],)",,Cognition and Perception

The second part deals with different types of semantics, ranging from more mental to more corporeal ones. The third part discusses issues of semantics related to embodiment. It is argued that the embodiment approach, by focusing on the role of the human body as mediator in a musical meaning formation process, may be a useful extension, and may perhaps be an alternative to the representational approach. An embodied approach to music semantics is fully embedded within an empirical and evidence-based research approach.

"In a humanitarian response, leaders are often tasked with making large numbers of decisions, many of which have significant consequences, in situations of urgency and uncertainty. These conditions have an impact on the decision-maker (causing stress, for example) and subsequently on how decisions get made.Evaluations of humanitarian action suggest that decision-making is an area of weakness in many operations. There are examples of important decisions being missed and of decision-making processes that are slow and ad hoc. As part of a research process to address these challenges, this article considers literature from the humanitarian and emergency management sectors that relates to decision-making. It outlines what the literature tells us about the nature of the decisions that leaders at the country level are taking during humanitarian operations, and the circumstances under which these decisions are taken. It then considers the potential application of two different types of decision-making process in these contexts: rational/analytical decision-making and naturalistic decision-making. The article concludes with broad hypotheses that can be drawn from the literature and with the recommendation that these be further tested by academics with an interest in the topic.","['Leah Campbell', 'Paul Knox Clarke']",10.1186/s41018-020-00068-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s41018-020-00068-2,4,2020,Decision-making at the sharp end: a survey of literature related to decision-making in humanitarian contexts,Journal of International Humanitarian Action,"([],)",,Social Psychology

"BackgroundThe consensus statement on the treatment of depression (Paykel &amp; Priest, 1992) advocates the use of cognitive therapy techniques as an adjunct to medication.MethodThis paper describes a randomised controlled trial of brief cognitive therapy (BCT) plus ‘treatment as usual’ versus treatment as usual in the management of 48 patients with major depressive disorder presenting in primary care.ResultsAt the end of the acute phase, significantly more subjects (P &lt; 0.05) met recovery criteria in the intervention group (n=15) compared with the control group (n=8). When initial neuroticism scores were controlled for, reductions in Beck Depression Inventory and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores favoured the BCT group throughout the 12 months of follow-up.ConclusionsBCT may be beneficial, but given the time constraints, therapists need to be more rather than less skilled in cognitive therapy. This, plus methodological limitations, leads us to advise caution before applying this approach more widely in primary care.","['', 'Scott C, Tacchi MJ, Jones R, Scott J.']",10.1192/bjp.171.2.131,http://dx.doi.org/10.1192/bjp.171.2.131,1,1997,Acute and one-year outcome of a randomised controlled trial of brief cognitive therapy for major depressive disorder in primary care,['British Journal of Psychiatry'],"(['Psychiatry and Mental health'],)",,Sociology

"The need for treating milder forms of depression has recently been of increased interest. This was a randomized, controlled study to evaluate the effects of telephone-based problem-solving therapy for mild depression. Comparison groups were a treatment-as-usual group and another group receiving stress-management training by telephone. From 1,742 family practice patients screened for depression, 54 with mild depression entered the study. Treatment was provided by experienced family practice nurses, trained and supervised in the treatments. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression was administered before and after the intervention period, and the Beck Depression Inventory and Duke Health Profile were administered at the end of the intervention period. Of the 36 subjects assigned to the problem-solving and stress-management groups, half dropped out early in the study. Five from the treatment-as-usual group were lost to follow-up. In the remaining subjects, there was a significant decrease in depression scores. There were no significant differences in the amount of decrease between the groups on any scores. The small sample and high dropout rate limit the interpretation of the findings. However, since all subjects tended to improve, regardless of treatment received, mild levels of depression may generally remit even without focal intervention, and watchful waiting may be a reasonable alternative for management.","['Smith MK.', 'Nagel R', 'Tamburrino M', 'Lynch D']",10.2466/pr0.94.3.785-792,http://dx.doi.org/10.2466/pr0.94.3.785-792,1,2004,Telephone-based treatment for family practice patients with mild depression,['Psychological Reports'],"(['General Psychology'],)",,Sociology

Methods                  We analyzed annual changes in four aspects of well-being over 5 years (2015–2020): life satisfaction, financial satisfaction, self-rated health, and loneliness in a subsample (n = 1,071, aged 65–71) from a larger survey of Swedish older adults. The 2020 wave, collected March 26–April 2, included measures of worry, risk perception, and social distancing in response to COVID-19.

(b) Well-being remained stable (life satisfaction and loneliness) or even increased (self-rated health and financial satisfaction) in 2020 compared to previous years. (c) More worry about health and financial consequences was related to lower scores in all four well-being measures.

"We examine the effects of Covid-19 and related restrictions on individuals with dependent children in Germany. We specifically focus on the role of day care center and school closures, which may be regarded as a “disruptive exogenous shock” to family life. We make use of a novel representative survey of parental well-being collected in May and June 2020 in Germany, when schools and day care centers were closed but while other measures had been relaxed and new infections were low. In our descriptive analysis, we compare well-being during this period with a pre-crisis period for different groups. In a difference-in-differences design, we compare the change for individuals with children to the change for individuals without children, accounting for unrelated trends as well as potential survey mode and context effects. We find that the crisis lowered the relative well-being of individuals with children, especially for individuals with young children, for women, and for persons with lower secondary schooling qualifications. Our results suggest that public policy measures taken to contain Covid-19 can have large effects on family well-being, with implications for child development and parental labor market outcomes.","['Gert G.

"A wide range of e-learning modalities are widely integrated in medical education. However, some of the key questions related to the role of e-learning remain unanswered, such as (1) what is an effective approach to integrating technology into pre-clinical vs. clinical training?; (2) what evidence exists regarding the type and format of e-learning technology suitable for medical specialties and clinical settings?; (3) which design features are known to be effective in designing on-line patient simulation cases, tutorials, or clinical exams?; and (4) what guidelines exist for determining an appropriate blend of instructional strategies, including online learning, face-to-face instruction, and performance-based skill practices? Based on the existing literature and a variety of e-learning examples of synchronous learning tools and simulation technology, this paper addresses the following three questions: (1) what is the current trend of e-learning in medical education?; (2) what do we know about the effective use of e-learning?; and (3) what is the role of e-learning in facilitating newly emerging competency-based training? As e-learning continues to be widely integrated in training future physicians, it is critical that our efforts in conducting evaluative studies should target specific e-learning features that can best mediate intended learning goals and objectives.

"Background: The surge in patients during the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the looming problem of staﬀ shortage in German ICUs possibly leading to worse outcomes for patients. Methods: Within the German Evidence Ecosystem CEOsys network, we conducted an online national mixed-methods survey assessing the standard of care in German ICUs treating patients with COVID-19. Results: A total of 171 German ICUs reported a median ideal number of patients per intensivist of 8 (interquartile range, IQR = 3rd quartile - 1st quartile = 4.0) and per nurse of 2.0 (IQR = 1.0). For COVID-19 patients, the median target was a maximum of 6.0 (IQR = 2.0) patients per intensivist or 2.0 (IQR = 0.0) patients per nurse. Targets for intensivists were rarely met by 15.2% and never met by 3.5% of responding institutions. Targets for nursing staﬃng could rarely be met in 32.2% and never in 5.3% of responding institutions.Conclusions: Shortages of staﬃng in the critical care setting are eminent during the COVID-19 pandemic and might not only negatively aﬀect patient outcomes, but also staﬀ wellbeing and healthcare costs.

Die Zufriedenheit mit der Gesundheit steigt uber alle Bevolkerungsgruppen hinweg deutlich an, wahrend Sorgen um die Gesundheit uber alle Gruppen deutlich sinken. Dies deutet darauf hin, dass die aktuelle Einschatzung stark im Kontext des Bedrohungsszenarios der Pandemie erfogt. Die subjektive Einsamkeit steigt uber alle betrachteten Gruppe sehr stark an. Der Anstieg fallt unter jungeren Menschen und Frauen etwas groser aus. Depressions- und Angstsymptome steigen ebenfalls an im Vergleich zu 2019, sind jedoch vergleichbar zum Nievau in 2016. Das Wohlbeﬁnden verandert sich insgesamt kaum, es zeigen sich jedoch kleine Geschlechterunterschiede.

"Performance measurement research has characteristically focused on the performance of individuals and has not addressed the measurement of teamwork skills. Dyer Suggested that this lack of teamwork measures presents serious problems for conducting team-oriented research because research efforts are often judged by the quality of the measurement device employed. In an effort to assess and advance the science of measuring teamwork, the current review examines the measurement of teamwork skills on theoretical, methodological, and psychometric grounds. Furthermore, we present a series of general principles to guide research in the future. Although some progress has been made, there is still much to be learned about the measurement of teamwork.","['Eduardo Salas', 'David P.

"The increasingly pervasive nature of the Web, expanding to devices and things in everyday life, along with new trends in Artificial Intelligence call for new paradigms and a new look on Knowledge Representation and Processing at scale for the Semantic Web. The emerging, but still to be concretely shaped concept of ""Knowledge Graphs"" provides an excellent unifying metaphor for this current status of Semantic Web research. More than two decades of Semantic Web research provides a solid basis and a promising technology and standards stack to interlink data, ontologies and knowledge on the Web. However, neither are applications for Knowledge Graphs as such limited to Linked Open Data, nor are instantiations of Knowledge Graphs in enterprises – while often inspired by – limited to the core Semantic Web stack. This report documents the program and the outcomes of Dagstuhl Seminar 18371 ""Knowledge Graphs: New Directions for Knowledge Representation on the Semantic Web"", where a group of experts from academia and industry discussed fundamental questions around these topics for a week in early September 2018, including the following: what are knowledge graphs?

"Graphs arise naturally in many real-world applications including social networks, recommender systems, ontologies, biology, and computational finance. Traditionally, machine learning models for graphs have been mostly designed for static graphs. However, many applications involve evolving graphs. This introduces important challenges for learning and inference since nodes, attributes, and edges change over time. In this survey, we review the recent advances in representation learning for dynamic graphs, including dynamic knowledge graphs. We describe existing models from an encoder-decoder perspective, categorize these encoders and decoders based on the techniques they employ, and analyze the approaches in each category. We also review several prominent applications and widely used datasets, and highlight directions for future research.

"A knowledge graph (KG), also known as a knowledge base, is a particular kind of network structure in which the node indicates entity and the edge represent relation. However, with the explosion of network volume, the problem of data sparsity that causes large-scale KG systems to calculate and manage difficultly has become more significant. For alleviating the issue, knowledge graph embedding is proposed to embed entities and relations in a KG to a low-, dense and continuous feature space, and endow the yield model with abilities of knowledge inference and fusion. In recent years, many researchers have poured much attention in this approach, and we will systematically introduce the existing state-of-the-art approaches and a variety of applications that benefit from these methods in this paper. In addition, we discuss future prospects for the development of techniques and application trends. Specifically, we first introduce the embedding models that only leverage the information of observed triplets in the KG. We illustrate the overall framework and specific idea and compare the advantages and disadvantages of such approaches. Next, we introduce the advanced models that utilize additional semantic information to improve the performance of the original methods. We divide the additional information into two categories, including textual descriptions and relation paths. The extension approaches in each category are described, following the same classification criteria as those defined for the triplet fact-based models. We then describe two experiments for comparing the performance of listed methods and mention some broader domain tasks such as question answering, recommender systems, and so forth. Finally, we collect several hurdles that need to be overcome and provide a few future research directions for knowledge graph embedding.","['Wenzhong Guo', 'Neal N.

"The purpose of this paper is to develop an understanding of the knowledge, skills and competencies demanded of early career information systems (IS) graduates in Australia. Online job advertisements from 2006 were collected and investigated using content analysis software to determine the frequencies and patterns of occurrence of specific requirements. This analysis reveals a dominant cluster of core IS knowledge and competency skills that revolves around IS Development as the most frequently required category of knowledge (78% of ads) and is strongly associated with: Business Analysis, Systems Analysis; Management; Operations, Maintenance & Support; Communication Skills; Personal Characteristics; Computer Languages; Data & Information Management; Internet, Intranet, Web Applications; and Software Packages. Identification of the core cluster of IS knowledge and skills - in demand across a wide variety of jobs - is important to better understand employers' needs for and expectations from IS graduates and the implications for education programs. Much less prevalent is the second cluster that includes knowledge and skills at a more technical side of IS (Architecture and Infrastructure, Operating Systems, Networks, and Security). Issues raised include the nature of entry level positions and their role in the preparation of their incumbents for future more senior positions. The findings add an Australian perspective to the literature on information systems job ads and should be of value to educators, employers, as well as current and future IS professionals.

"This paper examines trends in required job skills for IT professionals. Through an empirical study of classified job advertising for IT professionals over the past 17 years, we evaluate whether the observed trends support earlier predictions offered by researchers who sought to anticipate future job and skill demands (Leitheiser 1992; Trauth, Farwell, &amp; Lee 1993). Many of the findings are consistent with previous studies and support the notion that employers are seeking an ever-increasing number and variety of skill sets from the new hires. In addition, we found ongoing evidence of a recruitment gap (Todd, McKeen &amp; Gallupe 1995) where, despite many firms' stated emphasis on well-rounded individuals with business knowledge and strong ""soft skills,"" the job advertising aspect of the recruiting process continues to focus on ""hard skills"". The changing demand patterns for IT professionals necessitate life-long learning skills not only for IT practitioners but also for the academics who teach them.","['Duane P.

"This research addresses the competencies organizations use through project manager job advertisements. We develop a list of project manager job competencies; break down the competency components into knowledge, skills, and abilities; and conduct a comparative analysis of the use of these competencies. We examine the online contents of project manager job advertisements in the public domain. Analysis shows that industry job advertisements emphasize “soft skills” and competencies in a manner different than that in the literature. Additionally, differences are found across countries and between industries. Implications from the findings highlight the incongruent dissemination of project manager competencies, regional and industrial demands, and the recruitment of project managers.","['Kamrul Ahsan', 'Marcus Ho', 'Sabik Khan']",10.1002/pmj.21366,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pmj.21366,10,2013,Recruiting Project Managers: A Comparative Analysis of Competencies and Recruitment Signals from Job Advertisements,['Project Management Journal'],"(['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Strategy and Management', 'Business and International Management'],)",,"Work, Economy and Organizations"

"<jats:title content-type=""-heading"">Purpose                – In recent years, the term “smart city” has attracted a lot of attention from policy makers, business leaders and citizenship in general. Although there is not a unique definition of what a smart city is, it is generally accepted that “smart” urban policies refer to local governments’ initiatives that use information and communication technologies in order to increase the quality of life of their inhabitants while contributing to a sustainable development. So far, “smart city” approaches have generally been related to top-down processes of technology diffusion. The purpose of this paper is to present a broader view on “smart” initiatives to analyze both top-down and bottom-up dynamics in a smart city. The authors argue that these two perspectives are complementary and its combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city. Both perspectives are illustrated by providing examples of different “smart” aspects in the city of Barcelona: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data.                                        <jats:title content-type=""-heading"">Design/methodology/approach                – To illustrate the arguments, the authors analyze the case of the city of Barcelona providing examples of top-down and bottom-up initiatives in four different smart city aspects: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. The research method is based on a case study (Yin, 1984). The primary data consisted on interviews to city council representatives as well as managers of local public institutions, like economic development offices, and local organizations like for instance coworking spaces. The authors interviewed also specialists on the innovation history of the city in order to validate the data. In addition, the authors used secondary data such as reports on the 22@, and documentation on the Barcelona innovation policies, as well as doing a compilation of press articles and the online content of the institutional webpages. All together, the authors have followed a data triangulation strategy to seek data validation based on the cross-verification of the analyzed data sources.                                        <jats:title content-type=""-heading"">Findings                – The analysis suggests that the top-down and bottom-up perspectives are complementary and their combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city. Both perspectives are illustrated by providing examples of different “smart” aspects in the city of Barcelona: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data.                                        <jats:title content-type=""-heading"">Research limitations/implications                – Nevertheless, the analysis has its limitations. Even if the authors have emphasized the importance of the bottom-up initiatives, citizens do not have often the resources to act without governmental intervention. This is the case of services that require high-cost infrastructures or regulatory changes. Also, as it usually happens in the case of disruptive technology, it is hard for citizens to understand the possibilities of its use. In these cases, firms and institutions must play an important role in the first phases of the diffusion of innovations, by informing and incentivizing its use. It is also important to note that some of the emerging usages of technology are confronted to legal or regulatory issues. For instance, distributed and shared Wi-Fi networks might be in opposition to economic interests of internet providers, that often difficult its expansion. It is also the case of services of the sharing economy that represent a menace to established institutions (like the tensions between Uber and taxi companies, or Airbnb and hotels). In these cases, city halls like it is the case in Barcelona, tend to respond to these emergent uses of technology by regulating to ensure protection to existing corporate services.                                        <jats:title content-type=""-heading"">Practical implications                – In conclusion, the transformational process that leads a city to become a smart city has to take in consideration the complexity and the plurality of the urban reality. Beyond considering citizens as being users, testers or consumers of technology, local administrations that are able to identify, nourish and integrate the emerging citizens’ initiatives would contribute to the reinforcement of a smart city reality.                                        <jats:title content-type=""-heading"">Originality/value                – The contribution of the paper is to go beyond the generalized technologic discourse around smart cities by adding the layer of the citizens’ initiatives.","['Matías I.

"The restrictive measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have triggered sudden massive changes to travel behaviors of people all around the world. This study examines the individual mobility patterns for all transport modes (walk, bicycle, motorcycle, car driven alone, car driven in company, bus, subway, tram, train, airplane) before and during the restrictions adopted in ten countries on six continents: Australia, Brazil, China, Ghana, India, Iran, Italy, Norway, South Africa and the United States. This cross-country study also aims at understanding the predictors of protective behaviors related to the transport sector and COVID-19. Findings hinge upon an online survey conducted in May 2020 (N = 9,394). The empirical results quantify tremendous disruptions for both commuting and non-commuting travels, highlighting substantial reductions in the frequency of all types of trips and use of all modes. In terms of potential virus spread, airplanes and buses are perceived to be the riskiest transport modes, while avoidance of public transport is consistently found across the countries. According to the Protection Motivation Theory, the study sheds new light on the fact that two indicators, namely income inequality, expressed as Gini index, and the reported number of deaths due to COVID-19 per 100,000 inhabitants, aggravate respondents’ perceptions. This research indicates that socio-economic inequality and morbidity are not only related to actual health risks, as well documented in the relevant literature, but also to the perceived risks. These findings document the global impact of the COVID-19 crisis as well as provide guidance for transportation practitioners in developing future strategies.","['Taha Hossein Rashidi', 'Nithin Agarwal', 'Montasir Abbas', 'Amir Hessami', 'Benan Shu', 'Hao Chen', 'Shubham Goswami', 'Lei Yu', 'Solomon Adomako', 'Prince Peprah', 'Kasun Wijayaratna', 'Andrew Tucker', 'Yaning Qiao', 'Zhuangzhuang Liu', 'Sahra Naseri', 'Ali Foroutan Mirhosseini', 'Fusong Wang', 'Bhaven Naik', 'Navid Ghasemi', 'Louisa Lam', 'Brij Maharaj', 'Arunabha Banerjee', 'Kevin Fang', 'Akshay Gupta', 'Kevin Chang', 'Gaurav Sikka', 'Daniela Antunes Lessa', 'Inge Hoff', 'Cang Hui', 'Marco Passavanti', 'Baowen Lou', 'Diego Maria Barbieri']",10.1371/journal.pone.0245886,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245886,2,2021,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mobility in ten countries and associated perceived risk for all transport modes,PLOS ONE,"(['Multidisciplinary'],)",,Urban Studies and Planning
"Background                As a reaction to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), countries around the globe have implemented various measures to reduce the spread of the virus. The transportation sector is particularly affected by the pandemic situation. The current study aims to contribute to the empirical knowledge regarding the effects of the coronavirus situation on the mobility of people by (1) broadening the perspective to the mobility rural area’s residents and (2) providing subjective data concerning the perceived changes of affected persons’ mobility practices, as these two aspects have scarcely been considered in research so far.                              Methods                To address these research gaps, a mixed-methods study was conducted that integrates a qualitative telephone interview study (N = 15) and a quantitative household survey (N = 301). The rural district of Altmarkkreis Salzwedel in Northern Germany was chosen as a model region.                              Results                The results provide in-depth insights into the changing mobility practices of residents of a rural area during the legal restrictions to stem the spread of the virus. A high share of respondents (62.6%) experienced no changes in their mobility behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation. However, nearly one third of trips were also cancelled overall. A modal shift was observed towards the reduction of trips by car and bus, and an increase of trips by bike. The share of trips by foot was unchanged. The majority of respondents did not predict strong long-term effects of the corona pandemic on their mobility behavior.","['Annika Dreßler', 'Alexandra König']",10.1186/s12544-021-00472-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12544-021-00472-8,2,2021,A mixed-methods analysis of mobility behavior changes in the COVID-19 era in a rural case study,European Transport Research Review,"(['Mechanical Engineering', 'Transportation', 'Automotive Engineering'],)",,Urban Studies and Planning
"Background                The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to combat it led to severe constraints for various areas of life, including mobility. To study the effects of this disruptive situation on the mobility behaviour of entire subgroups, and how they shape their mobility in reaction to the special circumstances, can help to better understand, how people react to external changes.                              Methodology                Aim of the study presented in this article was to investigate to what extent, how and in what areas mobility behaviour has changed during the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany. In addition, a focus was put on the comparison of federal states with and without lockdown in order to investigate a possible contribution of this measure to changes in mobility. We asked respondents via an online survey about their trip purposes and trip frequency, their choice of transport mode and the reasons for choosing it in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. For the analyses presented in this paper, we used the data of 4157survey participants (2512 without lockdown, 1645 with lockdown).                              Results                The data confirmed a profound impact on the mobility behaviour with a shift away from public transport and increases in car usage, walking and cycling. Comparisons of federal states with and without lockdown revealed only isolated differences. It seems that, even if the lockdown had some minor effects, its role in the observed behavioural changes was minimal.","['Tibor Petzoldt', 'Lisa-Marie Schaefer', 'Angela Francke', 'Juliane Anke']",10.1186/s12544-021-00469-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12544-021-00469-3,1,2021,Impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the mobility behaviour in Germany,European Transport Research Review,"(['Mechanical Engineering', 'Transportation', 'Automotive Engineering'],)",,Urban Studies and Planning

Existing platforms vary widely in their approaches to: assessment, engagement, ideation, evaluation, and deliberation. We consider three online platforms: the Living Voters Guide, including its earlier iterations Consider.it and Reflect; the Open Town Hall; and the California Report Card. We compare them using the International Association of Public Participation’s “Spectrum of Public Participation” framework. Using a 10-point scale, we evaluate the user interface of each platform in terms of how well it supports the Spectrum’s levels of civic engagement (inform, consult, involve, collaborate, and empower). Results suggest how user interface design affects civic engagement and suggest opportunities for future work Collapse","['Ken Goldberg', 'John Scott', 'Jay Patel', 'Gavin Newsom', 'Ching-chang Allen Huang', 'Conrad Gregory', 'Chris Garland', 'Camille Crittenden', 'Daniel Catterson', 'Tanja Aitamurto', 'Sanjay Krishnan', 'Brandie Nonnecke', 'Matti Nelimarkka']",,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0bz755bj,0,0,Comparing Three Online Civic Engagement Platforms using the “Spectrum of Public Participation” Framework,"Internet, Policy, and Politics Conference on Crowdsourcing for Politics and Policy (IPP2014), Conference proceedings",,Political Science,Urban Studies and Planning

"Smart cities offer services to their inhabitants which make everyday life easier beyond providing a feedback channel to the city administration. For instance, a live timetable service for public transportation or real-time traffic jam notification can increase the efficiency of travel planning substantially. Traditionally, the implementation of these smart city services require the deployment of some costly sensing and tracking infrastructure. As an alternative, the crowd of inhabitants can be involved in data collection via their mobile devices. This emerging paradigm is called mobile crowd-sensing or participatory sensing. In this paper, we present our generic framework built upon XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) for mobile participatory sensing based smart city applications. After giving a short description of this framework we show three use-case smart city application scenarios, namely a live transit feed service, a soccer intelligence agency service and a smart campus application, which are currently under development on top of our framework.","['Gabor Feher', 'A Zs Nagy', 'Timon Tomas', 'Bernat Wiandt', 'Imre Lendak', 'Attila Adamko', 'Mark Kosa', 'Tamas Kadek', 'Tamas Szincsak', 'Gergely Köver', 'Mate Smajda', 'Renato Besenczi', 'Cs Sidlo', 'Lajos Kollar', 'Aniko Vagner', 'Sandor Laki', 'Peter Jeszenszky', 'Norbert Batfai', ' Andras A Benczur', 'Marton Ispany', '\u202aKaroly Farkas', 'Robert Szabo']",10.1109/COGINFOCOM.2013.6719260,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.997.3088&rep=rep1&type=pdf,12,2013,Framework for Smart City Applications Based on Participatory Sensing,IEEE ,,['Computer Science'],Urban Studies and Planning

"The transmedial discussion in this article shows that the terms narrative mediation and representation should be carefully distinguished from fiction or fictionality. The constitutive use of ‘real’ (or factual) artifacts in performative media (i. e. media which present embodied events, such as theater or film) provides a good example for the necessity of this distinction. Frequently these artifacts serve the purpose of a fictional discourse and certain definitions of fictionality (cf. Walton 1990) can be said to be fulfilled. However, a real-world artifact can by no means become itself fictive, but is rather used to represent a fictive entity. By focusing on representation and mediation instead, it becomes possible to compare theater with other performative media in terms of narrative representation: even though it is sense-physiologically unmediated, the functions of narrative mediation (i. e. selecting, ordering, presenting, commenting; cf. e. g. Chatman 1990) apply. The article establishes a dynamic system of representation that can be used for the analysis of all kinds of multichannel narrative media and thus rests the ongoing scholarly discussions of transmedial narrative representation on a much sounder theoretical basis. It distinguishes representation clearly from fictionality, and highlights the significance of theater in this discussion.",Jan Horstmann,10.1515/fns-2018-0030,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/fns-2018-0030,11,2018,Narrative representation and fictionality in performative media,Frontiers of Narrative Studies,"([],)",,Arts and Humanities

"This practice paper describes an ongoing research project to test the effectiveness and relevance of the FAIR Data Principles. Simultaneously, it will analyse how easy it is for data archives to adhere to the principles. The research took place from November 2016 to January 2017, and will be underpinned with feedback from the repositories.&#x0D;The FAIR Data Principles feature 15 facets corresponding to the four letters of FAIR - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable. These principles have already gained traction within the research world. The European Commission has recently expanded its demand for research to produce open data. The relevant guidelines1are explicitly written in the context of the FAIR Data Principles. Given an increasing number of researchers will have exposure to the guidelines, understanding their viability and suggesting where there may be room for modification and adjustment is of vital importance.&#x0D;This practice paper is connected to a dataset(Dunning et al.,2017) containing the original overview of the sample group statistics and graphs, in an Excel spreadsheet. Over the course of two months, the web-interfaces, help-pages and metadata-records of over 40 data repositories have been examined, to score the individual data repository against the FAIR principles and facets. The traffic-light rating system enables colour-coding according to compliance and vagueness. The statistical analysis provides overall, categorised, on the principles focussing, and on the facet focussing results.&#x0D;The analysis includes the statistical and descriptive evaluation, followed by elaborations on Elements of the FAIR Data Principles, the subject specific or repository specific differences, and subsequently what repositories can do to improve their information architecture.&#x0D;&#x0D;(1) H2020 Guidelines on FAIR Data Management:http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/oa_pilot/h2020-hi-oa-data-mgt_en.pdf&#x0D;","['Jasmin Böhmer', 'Madeleine De Smaele', 'Alastair Dunning']",10.2218/ijdc.v12i2.567,http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v12i2.567,12,2017,Are the FAIR Data Principles fair?,International Journal of Digital Curation,"([],)",,Arts and Humanities

"Language and literary studies have studied style for centuries, and even since the advent of ›stylistics‹ as a discipline at the beginning of the twentieth century, definitions of ›style‹ have varied heavily across time, space and fields. Today, with increasingly large collections of literary texts being made available in digital form, computational approaches to literary style are proliferating. New methods from disciplines such as corpus linguistics and computer science are being adopted and adapted in interrelated fields such as computational stylistics and corpus stylistics, and are facilitating new approaches to literary style.The relation between definitions of style in established linguistic or literary stylistics, and definitions of style in computational or corpus stylistics has not, however, been systematically assessed. This contribution aims to respond to the need to redefine style in the light of this new situation and to establish a clearer perception of both the overlap and the boundaries between ›mainstream‹ and ›computational‹ and/or ›empirical‹ literary stylistics. While stylistic studies of non-literary texts are currently flourishing, our contribution deliberately centers on those approaches relevant to ›literary stylistics‹. It concludes by proposing an operational definition of style that we hope can act as a common ground for diverse approaches to literary style, fostering transdisciplinary research.The focus of this contribution is on literary style in linguistics and literary studies (rather than in art history, musicology or fashion), on textual aspects of style (rather than production- or reception-oriented theories of style), and on a descriptive perspective (rather than a prescriptive or didactic one). Even within these limits, however, it appears necessary to build on a broad understanding of the various perspectives on style that have been adopted at different times and in different traditions. For this reason, the contribution first traces the development of the notion of style in three different traditions, those of German, Dutch and French language and literary studies. Despite the numerous links between each other, and between each of them to the British and American traditions, these three traditions each have their proper dynamics, especially with regard to the convergence and/or confrontation between mainstream and computational stylistics. For reasons of space and coherence, the contribution is limited to theoretical developments occurring since 1945.The contribution begins by briefly outlining the range of definitions of style that can be encountered across traditions today: style as revealing a higher-order aesthetic value, as the holistic ›gestalt‹ of single texts, as an expression of the individuality of an author, as an artifact presupposing choice among alternatives, as a deviation from a norm or reference, or as any formal property of a text. The contribution then traces the development of definitions of style in each of the three traditions mentioned, with the aim of giving a concise account of how, in each tradition, definitions of style have evolved over time, with special regard to the way such definitions relate to empirical, quantitative or otherwise computational approaches to style in literary texts. It will become apparent how, in each of the three traditions, foundational texts continue to influence current discussions on literary style, but also how stylistics has continuously reacted to broader developments in cultural and literary theory, and how empirical, quantitative or computational approaches have long ­existed, usually in parallel to or at the margins of mainstream stylistics. The review will also reflect the lines of discussion around style as a property of literary texts – or of any textual entity in general.The perspective on three stylistic traditions is accompanied by a more systematic perspective. The rationale is to work towards a common ground for literary scholars and linguists when talking about (literary) style, across traditions of stylistics, with respect for established definitions of style, but also in light of the digital paradigm. Here, we first show to what extent, at similar or different moments in time, the three traditions have developed comparable positions on style, and which definitions out of the range of possible definitions have been proposed or promoted by which authors in each of the three traditions.On the basis of this synthesis, we then conclude by proposing an operational definition of style that is an attempt to provide a common ground for both mainstream and computational literary stylistics. This definition is discussed in some detail in order to explain not only what is meant by each term in the definition, but also how it relates to computational analyses of style – and how this definition aims to avoid some of the pitfalls that can be perceived in earlier definitions of style. Our definition, we hope, will be put to use by a new generation of computational, quantitative, and empirical studies of style in literary texts.","['Christof Schöch', 'Karina van Dalen-Oskam', 'J.

". In 2017 we published a seminal research study in the International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing &amp;amp; Spatial Information Sciences about how smart city tools, solutions and applications underpinned historical and cultural heritage of cities at that time (Angelidou et al. 2017). We now return to investigate the progress that has been made during the past three years, and specifically whether the weak substantiation of cultural heritage in smart city strategies that we observed in 2017 has been improved. The newest literature suggests that smart cities should capitalize on local strengths and give prominence to local culture and traditions and provides a handful of solutions to this end. However, a more thorough examination of what has been actually implemented reveals a (still) rather immature approach. The smart city cases that were selected for the purposes of this research include Tarragona (Spain), Budapest (Hungary) and Karlsruhe (Germany). For each one we collected information regarding the overarching structure of the initiative, the positioning of cultural heritage and the inclusion of heritage-related smart city applications. We then performed a comparative analysis based on a simplified version of the Digital Strategy Canvas. Our findings suggest that a rich cultural heritage and a broader strategic focus on touristic branding and promotion are key ingredients of smart city development in this domain; this is a commonality of all the investigated cities. Moreover, three different strategy architectures emerge, representing the different interplays among the smart city, cultural heritage and sustainable urban development. We conclude that a new generation of smart city initiatives is emerging, in which cultural heritage is of increasing importance. This generation tends to associate cultural heritage with social and cultural values, liveability and sustainable urban development.","['E. Stylianidis', 'M.

"In this article, we share our experiences of using digital technologies and various media to present historical narratives of a museum object collection aiming to provide an engaging experience on multiple platforms. Based on P. Joseph’s article, Dawson presented multiple interpretations and historical views of the Markham car collection across various platforms using multimedia resources. Through her creative production, she explored how to use cylindrical panoramas and rich media to offer new ways of telling the controversial story of the contested heritage of a museum’s veteran and vintage car collection. The production’s usability was investigated involving five experts before it was published online and the general users’ experience was investigated. In this article, we present an important component of findings which indicates that virtual panorama tours featuring multimedia elements could be successful in attracting new audiences and that using this type of storytelling technique can be effective in the museum sector. The storyteller panorama tour presented here may stimulate GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums) professionals to think of new approaches, implement new strategies or services to engage their audiences more effectively.

"This article presents a case study of a collaborative public history project between participants in two countries, the United Kingdom and Italy. Its subject matter is the bombing war in Europe, 1939-1945, which is remembered and commemorated in very different ways in these two countries: the sensitivities involved thus constitute not only a case of public history conducted at the national level but also one involving contested heritage. An account of the ways in which public history has developed in the UK and Italy is presented. This is followed by an explanation of how the bombing war has been remembered in each country. In the UK, veterans of RAF Bomber Command have long felt a sense of neglect, largely because the deliberate targeting of civilians has not fitted comfortably into the dominant victor narrative. In Italy, recollections of being bombed have remained profoundly dissonant within the received liberation discourse. The International Bomber Command Centre Digital Archive (or Archive) is then described as a case study that employs a public history approach, focusing on various aspects of its inclusive ethos, intended to preserve multiple perspectives. The Italian component of the project is highlighted, problematising the digitisation of contested heritage within the broader context of twentieth-century history. Reflections on the use of digital archiving practices and working in partnership are offered, as well as a brief account of user analytics of the Archive through its first eighteen months online.","['Alessandro Pesaro', 'Zeno Gaiaschi', 'Greta Fedele', 'Heather Hughes']",10.5130/phrj.v27i0.7088,https://epress.lib.uts.edu.au/journals/index.php/phrj/article/view/7088,4,2020,Public History and Contested Heritage: Archival Memories of the Bombing of Italy,Public History Review,"([],)",,Cultural History
"One determining characteristic of contemporary sociopolitical systems is their power over increasingly large and diverse populations. This raises questions about power relations between heterogeneous individuals and increasingly dominant and homogenizing system objectives. This article crosses epistemic boundaries by integrating computer engineering and a historicalphilosophical approach making the general organization of individuals within large-scale systems and corresponding individual homogenization intelligible. From a versatile archeological-genealogical perspective, an analysis of computer and social architectures is conducted that reinterprets Foucault’s disciplines and political anatomy to establish the notion of politics for a purely technical system. This permits an understanding of system organization as modern technology with application to technical and social systems alike. Connecting to Heidegger’s notions of the enframing (Gestell) and a more primal truth (anfänglicheren Wahrheit), the recognition of politics in differently developing systems then challenges the immutability of contemporary organization. Following this critique of modernity and within the conceptualization of system organization, Derrida’s democracy to come (à venir) is then reformulated more ly as organizations to come. Through the integration of the discussed concepts, the framework of Large-Scale Systems Composed of Homogeneous Individuals (LSSCHI) is proposed, problematizing the relationships between individuals, structure, activity, and power within large-scale systems. The LSSCHI framework highlights the conflict of homogenizing system-level objectives and individual heterogeneity, and outlines power relations and mechanisms of control shared across different social and technical systems.","['Andrés Laguna-Tapia', 'Jens Bürger']",10.1057/s41599-020-0425-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41599-020-0425-4,3,2020,Individual homogenization in large-scale systems: on the politics of computer and social architectures,Palgrave Communications,"(['General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'General Psychology', 'General Social Sciences', 'General Arts and Humanities'],)",,Ethics and Political Philosophy

"The epistemic attitudes of scientists, such as epistemic tolerance and authoritarianism, play important roles in the discourse about rivaling theories. Epistemic tolerance stands for the mental attitude of an epistemic agent, e.g., a scientist, who is open to opposing views, while epistemic authoritarianism represents the tendency to uncritically accept views of authorities. Another relevant epistemic factor when it comes to the epistemic decisions of scientists is the skepticism towards the scientific method. However, the question is whether these epistemic attitudes are influenced by their sociopolitical counterparts, such as the researcher’s degree of conservatism. To empirically investigate the interplay between epistemic and sociopolitical attitudes of scientists, we conducted a survey with researchers (N = 655) across different disciplines. We propose scales for measuring epistemic tolerance and epistemic authoritarianism, as well as a scale for detecting the participants' readiness to question the scientific method. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between epistemic tolerance and epistemic authoritarianism on the one hand, and career stage and sociopolitical views on the other hand. Interestingly, our study found only small correlations between the participants' degree of conservatism and their epistemic attitudes. This suggests that political views, against common argumentation, actually do not play an important role in one’s scientific decisions. Moreover, social scientists scored higher on the epistemic tolerance and lower on the epistemic authoritarianism scale than natural scientists. Finally, the results indicate that natural scientists question the scientific method less than social scientists.","['Vanja Subotić', 'Miljan Vasić', 'Tijana Nikitović', 'Vlasta Sikimić']",10.1007/s13164-020-00504-7,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13164-020-00504-7,8,2020,Do Political Attitudes Matter for Epistemic Decisions of Scientists?,Review of Philosophy and Psychology,"(['Philosophy', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology'],)",,Philosophy of Science

"Focusing on the archival records of the production and performance of Dance in Trees and Church by the Swedish independent dance group Rubicon, this article conceptualizes a records-oriented costume ethics. Theorizations of costume as a co-creative agent of performance are brought into the dance archive to highlight the productivity of paying attention to costume in the making of performance history. Addressing recent developments within archival studies, a feminist ethics of care and radical empathy is employed, which is the capability to empathically engage with others, even if it can be difficult, as a means of exploring how a records-centred costume ethics can be conceptualized for the dance archive. The exploration resulted in two ethical stances useful for better attending to costume-bodies in the dance archive: (1) caring for costume-body relations in the dance archive means that a conventional, so-called static understanding of records as neutral carriers of facts is replaced by a more inclusive, expanding and infinite process. By moving across time and space, and with a caring attitude finding and exploring fragments from various, sometimes contradictory production processes, one can help scattered and poorly represented dance and costume histories to emerge and contribute to the formation of identity and memory. (2) The use of bodily empathy with records can respectfully bring together the understanding of costume in performance as inseparable from the performer’s body with dance as an art form that explicitly uses the dancing costume-body as an expressive tool. It is argued that bodily empathy with records in the dance archive helps one access bodily holisms that create possibilities for exploring the potential of art to critically expose and render strange ideological systems and normativities.",Astrid von Rosen,10.1386/scp_00012_1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1386/scp_00012_1,6,2020,Costume in the dance archive: Towards a records-centred ethics of care,Studies in Costume & Performance,"([],)",,Ethics
"The positioning in space and time of performed narration in theater poses a specific challenge to classical narratological categories of structuralist descent (developed, for example, by Gérard Genette or Wolf Schmid, for the analysis of narrative fiction). Time is the phenomenon which connects narratology and theater studies: on the one hand, it provides the basis for nearly every definition of narrativity; on the other, it grounds a number of different methodologies for the analysis of theater stagings, as well as theories of performance – with their emphasis on transience, the ephemeral, and the unrepeatable, singular or transitory nature of the technically unreproducible art of theater (e. g. by Erika Fischer-Lichte). This turn towards temporality is also present in theories of postdramatic theater (by Hans-Thies Lehman) and performance art. Narrating always takes place in time; likewise, every performance is a handling of and an encounter with time. Furthermore, performed narration gains a concrete spatial setting by virtue of its location on a stage or comparable performance area, so that the spatial structures contained in this setting exist in relation to the temporal structures of the act of theatrical telling, as well as the content of what is told. Both temporal and spatial structures of theater stagings can be systematically described and analyzed with a narratological vocabulary. With references to Seymour Chatman, Käte Hamburger and Markus Kuhn among others, the contribution discusses how narratological parameters for the analysis of temporal and spatial relations can be productively expanded in relation to theater and performance analysis. For exemplary purposes, it refers to Dimiter Gotscheff’s staging of Peter Handke’s Immer noch Sturm (which premiered in 2011 at the Thalia Theater Hamburg in cooperation with the Salzburger Festspiele), focusing on its transmedial broadening of temporal categories like order, duration, and frequency, and subsequent, prior, or simultaneous narration. The broadening itself proves feasible since all categories of temporal narration can be applied to performative narration in the theater – at times even more fruitfully than in written language, as is the case, for example, with the concept of ›duration‹. The concept of ›time of narration‹ too can be productively applied to theater. Whilst a subsequent narration is frequently considered the standard case in written-language narratives on the one hand – a conclusion that is, however, only correct if the narrator figure and narrative stand in spatiotemporal relation to one another, i. e. if a homodiegetic narrator figure is present – it is commonly held that in scenic-performed narration, on the other hand, the telling and the told take place simultaneously. The present contribution argues against this interpretation, as it stems from a misguided understanding of the ›liveness‹ of performance. ›Liveness‹ refers only to the relationship between viewers and performers and their respective presence, but not to their temporal and spatial relationship to the told. Rather, the following will argue that the time of narration in theater (as well as in film) stays unmarked in most cases. It is possible, however, to stage subsequent, prior, or simultaneous narration, too. Immer noch Sturm is one example for a performed subsequent narration. For audiovisual narration, then, a special case of iterative narration (telling once what happened n times) can be identified, which is to tell a few times (n minus x) what happened n times. As an additional category for the analysis of narrative temporality in audiovisual narrative media, I propose what I venture to call ›synchronized narration‹, in order to describe the specificity of spatiotemporal relations in performance. In synchronized narration, two or more events (that happen at different places or times in the narrative world) are shown at the same time on stage. This synchronized performance of several events is only realizable within the audiovisual dimension of spatial narration and not in written-language based narration. Furthermore, for narrative space relations the categories ›space covering‹, ›space extending‹, and ›space reducing narration‹ are suggested in order to analyze the relationships between discourse space and story space(s). Discourse space emerges in the concrete physical space of the performance when narrativity is present. Within this discourse space any amount of story spaces (with any expansion) can emerge. However, whilst in time-extending narration the time of the telling is longer than the time of the told, in space-extending narration the told space is bigger than the space of the telling. This principle is analogously valid for time-reducing or space-reducing narration. The transmission and media-specific broadening of temporal and spatial narratological parameters reveals how time and space form a continuum and should thus be linked and discussed alongside one another in analytical approaches to narrative artifacts. The staging of Immer noch Sturm actualizes a metaleptic structure, in which temporal borders are systematically dissolved and the overstepping of spatial borders becomes an indicator for the merging of different temporal levels.

"Named entity recognition has served many natural language processing tasks such as information retrieval, machine translation, and question answering systems. Many researchers have addressed the name identification issue in a variety of languages and recently some research efforts have started to focus on named entity recognition for the Arabic language. We present a working Arabic information extraction (IE) system that is used to analyze large volumes of news texts every day to extract the named entity (NE) types person, organization, location, date, and number, as well as quotations (direct reported speech) by and about people. The named entity recognition (NER) system was not developed for Arabic, but instead a multilingual NER system was adapted to also cover Arabic. The Semitic language Arabic substantially differs from the Indo-European and Finno-Ugric languages currently covered. This article thus describes what Arabic language-specific resources had to be developed and what changes needed to be made to the rule set in order to be applicable to the Arabic language. The achieved evaluation results are generally satisfactory, but could be improved for certain entity types.",W.

"In health care information systems, electronic health records are an important part of the knowledge concerning individual health histories. Extracting valuable knowledge from these records represents a challenging task because they are composed of data of different kind: images, test results, narrative texts that include both highly codified and a variety of notes which are diverse in language and detail, as well as ad hoc terminology, including acronyms and jargon, far from being highly codified. This paper proposes a combined approach for the recognition of named entities in such narrative texts. This approach is a composition of three different methods. The possible combinations are evaluated and the resulting composition shows an improvement of the recall and a limited impact on precision for the named entity recognition process.","A.P.

"OBJECTIVESNamed entity recognition (NER), a sequential labeling task, is one of the fundamental tasks for building clinical natural language processing (NLP) systems. Machine learning (ML) based approaches can achieve good performance, but they often require large amounts of annotated samples, which are expensive to build due to the requirement of domain experts in annotation. Active learning (AL), a sample selection approach integrated with supervised ML, aims to minimize the annotation cost while maximizing the performance of ML-based models. In this study, our goal was to develop and evaluate both existing and new AL methods for a clinical NER task to identify concepts of medical problems, treatments, and lab tests from the clinical notes.METHODSUsing the annotated NER corpus from the 2010 i2b2/VA NLP challenge that contained 349 clinical documents with 20,423 unique sentences, we simulated AL experiments using a number of existing and novel algorithms in three different categories including uncertainty-based, diversity-based, and baseline sampling strategies. They were compared with the passive learning that uses random sampling. Learning curves that plot performance of the NER model against the estimated annotation cost (based on number of sentences or words in the training set) were generated to evaluate different active learning and the passive learning methods and the area under the learning curve (ALC) score was computed.RESULTSBased on the learning curves of F-measure vs. number of sentences, uncertainty sampling algorithms outperformed all other methods in ALC. Most diversity-based methods also performed better than random sampling in ALC. To achieve an F-measure of 0.80, the best method based on uncertainty sampling could save 66% annotations in sentences, as compared to random sampling. For the learning curves of F-measure vs. number of words, uncertainty sampling methods again outperformed all other methods in ALC. To achieve 0.80 in F-measure, in comparison to random sampling, the best uncertainty based method saved 42% annotations in words. But the best diversity based method reduced only 7% annotation effort.CONCLUSIONIn the simulated setting, AL methods, particularly uncertainty-sampling based approaches, seemed to significantly save annotation cost for the clinical NER task. The actual benefit of active learning in clinical NER should be further evaluated in a real-time setting.","Y. Chen, T.A. Lasko, Q. Mei, J.C. Denny, H.

"This paper addresses the problem of Named Entity Recognition in Query (NERQ), which involves detection of the named entity in a given query and classification of the named entity into predefined classes. NERQ is potentially useful in many applications in web search. The paper proposes taking a probabilistic approach to the task using query log data and Latent Dirichlet Allocation. We consider contexts of a named entity (i.e., the remainders of the named entity in queries) as words of a document, and classes of the named entity as topics. The topic model is constructed by a novel and general learning method referred to as WS-LDA (Weakly Supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation), which employs weakly supervised learning (rather than unsupervised learning) using partially labeled seed entities. Experimental results show that the proposed method based on WS-LDA can accurately perform NERQ, and outperform the baseline methods.","J. Guo, G. Xu, X. Cheng, H.

"One difficulty with machine learning for information extraction is the high cost of collecting labeled examples. Active Learning can make more efficient use of the learner's time by asking them to label only instances that are most useful for the trainer. In random sampling approach, unlabeled data is selected for annotation at random and thus can't yield the desired results. In contrast, active learning selects the useful data from a huge pool of unlabeled data for the classifier. The strategies used often classify the corpus tokens (or, data points) into wrong classes. The classifier is confused between two categories if the token is located near the margin. We propose a novel method for solving this problem and show that it favorably results in the increased performance. Our approach is based on the supervised machine learning algorithm, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed approach is applied for solving the problem of named entity recognition (NER) in two Indian languages, namely Hindi and Bengali. Results show that proposed active learning based technique indeed improves the performance of the system.","A. Ekbal, S. Saha, D.

"In this paper, we propose a simulated annealing (SA) based multiobjective optimization (MOO) approach for classifier ensemble. Several different versions of the objective functions are exploited. We hypothesize that the reliability of prediction of each classifier differs among the various output classes. Thus, in an ensemble system, it is necessary to find out the appropriate weight of vote for each output class in each classifier. Diverse classification methods such as Maximum Entropy (ME), Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used to build different models depending upon the various representations of the available features. One most important characteristics of our system is that the features are selected and developed mostly without using any deep domain knowledge and/or language dependent resources. The proposed technique is evaluated for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in three resource-poor Indian languages, namely Bengali, Hindi and Telugu. Evaluation results yield the recall, precision and F-measure values of 93.95%, 95.15% and 94.55%, respectively for Bengali, 93.35%, 92.25% and 92.80%, respectively for Hindi and 84.02%, 96.56% and 89.85%, respectively for Telugu.

"Recognizing and disambiguating bio-entities (genes, proteins, cells, etc.) names are very challenging tasks as some biologica databases can be outdated, names may not be normalized, abbreviations are used, syntactic and word order is modified, etc. Thus, the same bio-entity might be written into different ways making searching tasks a key obstacle as many candidate relevant literature containing those entities might not be found. As consequence, the same protein mention but using different names should be looked for or the same discovered protein name is being used to name a new protein using completely different features hence named-entity recognition methods are required. In this paper, we developed a bio-entity recognition model which combines different classification methods and incorporates simple pre-processing tasks for bio-entities (genes and proteins) recognition is presented. Linguistic pre-processing and feature representation for training and testing is observed to positively affect the overall performance of the method, showing promising results. Unlike some state-of-the-art methods, the approach does not require additional knowledge bases or specific-purpose tasks for post processing which make it more appealing. Experiments showing the promise of the model compared to other state-of-the-art methods are discussed.","J. Etkinson, V.

"Named Entity Recognition and Classiﬁcation (NERC) is one of the most fundamental and important tasks in biomedical informa–tion extraction. Biomedical named entities (NEs) include mentions of proteins, genes, DNA, RNA etc. which, in general, have complex structures and are difﬁcult to recognize. We have developed a large number of features for identifying NEs from biomed–ical texts. Two robust diverse classiﬁcation methods like Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used to build a number of models depending upon the various representations of the set of features and/or feature templates. Finally the outputs of these different classiﬁers are combined using multiobjective weighted voted approach. We hypothesize that the reliability of predictions of each classiﬁer differs among the various output classes. Thus, in an ensemble system, it is neces–sary to determine the appropriate weight of vote for each output class in each classiﬁer. Here, a multiobjective genetic algorithm is utilized for determining appropriate weights of votes for combining the outputs of classiﬁers.

"One main challenge of Named Entities Recognition (NER) for tweets is the insufficient information in a single tweet, owing to the noisy and short nature of tweets. We propose a novel system to tackle this challenge, which leverages redundancy in tweets by conducting two-stage NER for multiple similar tweets. Particularly, it first pre-labels each tweet using a sequential labeler based on the linear Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) model. Then it clusters tweets to put tweets with similar content into the same group. Finally, for each cluster it refines the labels of each tweet using an enhanced CRF model that incorporates the cluster level information, i.e., the labels of the current word and its neighboring words across all tweets in the cluster. We evaluate our method on a manually annotated dataset, and show that our method boosts the F1 of the baseline without collectively labeling from 75.4% to 82.5%.","X. Liu, M.

"In this paper, we pose the classifier ensemble problem under single and multiobjective optimization frameworks, and evaluate it for Named Entity Recognition (NER), an important step in almost all Natural Language Processing (NLP) application areas. We propose the solutions to two different versions of the ensemble problem for each of the optimization frameworks. We hypothesize that the reliability of predictions of each classifier differs among the various output classes. Thus, in an ensemble system it is necessary to find out either the eligible classes for which a classifier is most suitable to vote (i.e., binary vote based ensemble) or to quantify the amount of voting for each class in a particular classifier (i.e., real vote based ensemble). We use seven diverse classifiers, namely Naive Bayes, Decision Tree (DT), Memory Based Learner (MBL), Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Maximum Entropy (ME), Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to build a number of models depending upon the various representations of the available features that are identified and selected mostly without using any domain knowledge and/or language specific resources. The proposed technique is evaluated for three resource-constrained languages, namely Bengali, Hindi and Telugu. Results using multiobjective optimization (MOO) based technique yield the overall recall, precision and F-measure values of 94.21%, 94.72% and 94.74%, respectively for Bengali, 99.07%, 90.63% and 94.66%, respectively for Hindi and 82.79%, 95.18% and 88.55%, respectively for Telugu. Results for all the languages show that the proposed MOO based classifier ensemble with real voting attains the performance level which is superior to all the individual classifiers, three baseline ensembles and the corresponding single objective based ensemble.","S.

This debate is fueled by surface problems of definition and vested interests of professional educators, but is more deeply marked by epistemological assumptions relative to the role of humans and human interaction in education and learning. The seminal article by Daniel and Marquis (1979) challenged distance educators to get the mixture right between independent study and interactive learning strategies and activities. They quite rightly pointed out that these two primary forms of education have differing economic, pedagogical, and social characteristics, and that we are unlikely to find a “perfect” mix that meets all learner and institutional needs across all curricula and content. Nonetheless, hard decisions have to be made.&#x0D;Even more than in 1979, the development of newer, cost effective technologies and the nearly ubiquitous (in developed countries) Net-based telecommunications system is transforming, at least, the cost and access implications of getting the mix right. Further, developments in social cognitive based learning theories are providing increased evidence of the importance of collaborative activity as a component of all forms of education – including those delivered at a distance. Finally, the context in which distance education is developed and delivered is changing in response to the capacity of the semantic Web (Berners-Lee, 1999) to support interaction, not only amongst humans, but also between and among autonomous agents and human beings.&#x0D;Thus, the landscape and challenges of “getting the mix right” have not lessened in the past 25 years, and, in fact, have become even more complicated. This paper attempts to provide a theoretical rationale and guide for instructional designers and teachers interested in developing distance education systems that are both effective and efficient in meeting diverse student learning needs.",Terry Anderson,10.19173/irrodl.v4i2.149,http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/149/708,10,2003,Getting the Mix Right Again: An updated and theoretical rationale for interaction,International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning,"(['Education'],)",,Learner-Interface Interaction

"In the presented study, dithi(ol)anylium tetrafluoroborates are added to α,β-unsaturated ketones in a Michael-type reaction yielding diverse substituted ketene diothi(ol)anes. The reactions proceed at room temperature in 1 or 13 h without the need of further additives. The presented procedure is in particular useful for dithi(ol)anylium tetrafluoroborates without electron-withdrawing groups in α-position. This is advantageous with respect to previous approaches, which were limited to the use of ketene dithioacetals substituted with electron-withdrawing groups. Aiming for the systematic investigation of possible steric and electronic influences on the outcome of the reaction, various combinations of electrophiles and nucleophiles were used and the results of the reactions were compared based on the type of the used dithioacetal. The scope of the presented procedure is shown with four additional transformations including the use of additional electrophiles and nucleophiles, the use of a chiral auxiliary and subsequent reduction of selected products. Additionally, we extended the reaction to the synthesis of diene dithiolanes by addition of an ynone to α-alkyl or aryl-substitued dithiolanylium TFBs.","['Stefan Bräse', 'Nicole Jung', 'Sylvia Vanderheiden', 'Simone Gräßle', 'An Nguyen', 'Yu-Chieh Huang']",10.3762/bjoc.14.37,http://dx.doi.org/10.3762/bjoc.14.37,2,2018,"Addition of dithi(ol)anylium tetrafluoroborates to α,β-unsaturated ketones",Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry,"(['Organic Chemistry'],)",,Organic Molecular Chemistry - Synthesis and Characterisation
"Remote sensing is a useful tool for monitoring spatio-temporal variations of crop morphological and physiological status and supporting practices in precision farming. In comparison with multispectral imaging, hyperspectral imaging is a more advanced technique that is capable of acquiring a detailed spectral response of target features. Due to limited accessibility outside of the scientific community, hyperspectral images have not been widely used in precision agriculture. In recent years, different mini-sized and low-cost airborne hyperspectral sensors (e.g., Headwall Micro-Hyperspec, Cubert UHD 185-Firefly) have been developed, and advanced spaceborne hyperspectral sensors have also been or will be launched (e.g., PRISMA, DESIS, EnMAP, HyspIRI). Hyperspectral imaging is becoming more widely available to agricultural applications. Meanwhile, the acquisition, processing, and analysis of hyperspectral imagery still remain a challenging research topic (e.g., large data volume, high data dimensionality, and complex information analysis). It is hence beneficial to conduct a thorough and in-depth review of the hyperspectral imaging technology (e.g., different platforms and sensors), methods available for processing and analyzing hyperspectral information, and recent advances of hyperspectral imaging in agricultural applications. Publications over the past 30 years in hyperspectral imaging technology and applications in agriculture were thus reviewed. The imaging platforms and sensors, together with analytic methods used in the literature, were discussed. Performances of hyperspectral imaging for different applications (e.g., crop biophysical and biochemical properties’ mapping, soil characteristics, and crop classification) were also evaluated. This review is intended to assist agricultural researchers and practitioners to better understand the strengths and limitations of hyperspectral imaging to agricultural applications and promote the adoption of this valuable technology. Recommendations for future hyperspectral imaging research for precision agriculture are also presented.","['Jiali Shang', 'Yuhong He', 'Jiangui Liu', 'Phuong Dao', 'Bing Lu']",10.3390/rs12162659,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12162659,0,0,Recent Advances of Hyperspectral Imaging Technology and Applications in Agriculture,Remote Sensing,"(['General Earth and Planetary Sciences'],)",,Planetary Sciences

"Geochemical models for Mars predict carbonate formation during aqueous alteration. Carbonate-bearing rocks had not previously been detected on Mars' surface, but Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter mapping reveals a regional rock layer with near-infrared spectral characteristics that are consistent with the presence of magnesium carbonate in the Nili Fossae region. The carbonate is closely associated with both phyllosilicate-bearing and olivine-rich rock units and probably formed during the Noachian or early Hesperian era from the alteration of olivine by either hydrothermal fluids or near-surface water. The presence of carbonate as well as accompanying clays suggests that waters were neutral to alkaline at the time of its formation and that acidic weathering, proposed to be characteristic of Hesperian Mars, did not destroy these carbonates and thus did not dominate all aqueous environments.","['James J.

"Background            The COVID-19 outbreak has affected the lives of millions of people by causing a dramatic impact on many health care systems and the global economy. This devastating pandemic has brought together communities across the globe to work on this issue in an unprecedented manner.                                Objective            This case study describes the steps and methods employed in the conduction of a remote online health hackathon centered on challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. It aims to deliver a clear implementation road map for other organizations to follow.                                Methods            This 4-day hackathon was conducted in April 2020, based on six COVID-19–related challenges defined by frontline clinicians and researchers from various disciplines. An online survey was structured to assess: (1) individual experience satisfaction, (2) level of interprofessional skills exchange, (3) maturity of the projects realized, and (4) overall quality of the event. At the end of the event, participants were invited to take part in an online survey with 17 (+5 optional) items, including multiple-choice and open-ended questions that assessed their experience regarding the remote nature of the event and their individual project, interprofessional skills exchange, and their confidence in working on a digital health project before and after the hackathon. Mentors, who guided the participants through the event, also provided feedback to the organizers through an online survey.                                Results            A total of 48 participants and 52 mentors based in 8 different countries participated and developed 14 projects. A total of 75 mentorship video sessions were held. Participants reported increased confidence in starting a digital health venture or a research project after successfully participating in the hackathon, and stated that they were likely to continue working on their projects. Of the participants who provided feedback, 60% (n=18) would not have started their project without this particular hackathon and indicated that the hackathon encouraged and enabled them to progress faster, for example, by building interdisciplinary teams, gaining new insights and feedback provided by their mentors, and creating a functional prototype.                                Conclusions            This study provides insights into how online hackathons can contribute to solving the challenges and effects of a pandemic in several regions of the world. The online format fosters team diversity, increases cross-regional collaboration, and can be executed much faster and at lower costs compared to in-person events. Results on preparation, organization, and evaluation of this online hackathon are useful for other institutions and initiatives that are willing to introduce similar event formats in the fight against COVID-19.","['Akira-Sebastian Poncette', 'Valerie Kirchberger', 'Sascha Lieber', 'Sylvia Thun', 'Felix Balzer', 'Anastasiya Lebedev', 'Alvaro Valera Sosa', 'Joscha Hofferbert', 'Pablo-David Rojas', 'Katarina Braune']",10.2196/25283,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/25283,2,2021,Interdisciplinary Online Hackathons as an Approach to Combat the COVID-19 Pandemic: Case Study,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"(['Health Informatics'],)",,"Information Systems, Process and Knowledge Management"

"The study of global biodiversity will greatly benefit from access to comprehensive DNA barcode libraries at continental scale, but such datasets are still very rare. Here, we assemble the first high-resolution reference library for European butterflies that provides 97% taxon coverage (459 species) and 22,306 COI sequences. We estimate that we captured 62% of the total haplotype diversity and show that most species possess a few very common haplotypes and many rare ones. Specimens in the dataset have an average 95.3% probability of being correctly identified. Mitochondrial diversity displayed elevated haplotype richness in southern European refugia, establishing the generality of this key biogeographic pattern for an entire taxonomic group. Fifteen percent of the species are involved in barcode sharing, but two thirds of these cases may reflect the need for further taxonomic research. This dataset provides a unique resource for conservation and for studying evolutionary processes, cryptic species, phylogeography, and ecology.","['Roger Vila', 'Paul D. N.

"BackgroundWith about 1,000 species in the Neotropics, the Eumaeini (Theclinae) are one of the most diverse butterfly tribes. Correct morphology-based identifications are challenging in many genera due to relatively little interspecific differences in wing patterns. Geographic infraspecific variation is sometimes more substantial than variation between species. In this paper we present a large DNA barcode dataset of South American Lycaenidae. We analyze how well DNA barcode BINs match morphologically delimited species.MethodsWe compare morphology-based species identifications with the clustering of molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) delimitated by the RESL algorithm in BOLD, which assigns Barcode Index Numbers (BINs). We examine intra- and interspecific divergences for genera represented by at least four morphospecies. We discuss the existence of local barcode gaps in a genus by genus analysis. We also note differences in the percentage of species with barcode gaps in groups of lowland and high mountain genera.ResultsWe identified 2,213 specimens and obtained 1,839 sequences of 512 species in 90 genera. Overall, the mean intraspecific divergence value of CO1 sequences was 1.20%, while the mean interspecific divergence between nearest congeneric neighbors was 4.89%, demonstrating the presence of a barcode gap. However, the gap seemed to disappear from the entire set when comparing the maximum intraspecific distance (8.40%) with the minimum interspecific distance (0.40%). Clear barcode gaps are present in many genera but absent in others. From the set of specimens that yielded COI fragment lengths of at least 650 bp, 75% of the a priori morphology-based identifications were unambiguously assigned to a single Barcode Index Number (BIN). However, after a taxonomic a posteriori review, the percentage of matched identifications rose to 85%. BIN splitting was observed for 17% of the species and BIN sharing for 9%. We found that genera that contain primarily lowland species show higher percentages of local barcode gaps and congruence between BINs and morphology than genera that contain exclusively high montane species. The divergence values to the nearest neighbors were significantly lower in high Andean species while the intra-specific divergence values were significantly lower in the lowland species. These results raise questions regarding the causes of observed low inter and high intraspecific genetic variation. We discuss incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization as most likely causes of this phenomenon, as the montane species concerned are relatively young and hybridization is probable. The release of our data set represents an essential baseline for a reference library for biological assessment studies of butterflies in mega diverse countries using modern high-throughput technologies an highlights the necessity of taxonomic revisions for various genera combining both molecular and morphological data.","['Axel Hausmann', 'Robert Robbins', 'Christophe Faynel', 'Carlos Prieto']",10.7717/peerj.11843,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.11843,8,2021,Congruence between morphology-based species and Barcode Index Numbers (BINs) in Neotropical Eumaeini (Lycaenidae),PeerJ,"(['General Agricultural and Biological Sciences', 'General Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology', 'General Medicine', 'General Neuroscience'],)",,"Ecology and Biodiversity of Animals and Ecosystems, Organismic Interactions"

"Cryptic biological diversity has generated ambiguity in taxonomic and evolutionary studies. Single-locus methods and other approaches for species delimitation are useful for addressing this challenge, enabling the practical processing of large numbers of samples for identification and inventory purposes. This study analyzed an assemblage of high Andean butterflies using DNA barcoding and compared the identifications based on the current morphological taxonomy with three methods of species delimitation (automatic barcode gap discovery, generalized mixed Yule coalescent model, and Poisson tree processes). Sixteen potential cryptic species were recognized using these three methods, representing a net richness increase of 11.3% in the assemblage. A well-studied taxon of the genus Vanessa, which has a wide geographical distribution, appeared with the potential cryptic species that had a higher genetic differentiation at the local level than at the continental level. The analyses were useful for identifying the potential cryptic species in Pedaliodes and Forsterinaria complexes, which also show differentiation along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients. This genetic assessment of an entire assemblage of high Andean butterflies (Papilionoidea) provides baseline information for future research in a region characterized by high rates of endemism and population isolation.","['Carlos Federico Álvarez', 'Sandra Inés Uribe', 'Andre V.

"Although the butterflies of North America have received considerable taxonomic attention, overlooked species and instances of hybridization continue to be revealed. The present study assembles a DNA barcode reference library for this fauna to identify groups whose patterns of sequence variation suggest the need for further taxonomic study. Based on 14,626 records from 814 species, DNA barcodes were obtained for 96% of the fauna. The maximum intraspecific distance averaged 1/4 the minimum distance to the nearest neighbor, producing a barcode gap in 76% of the species. Most species (80%) were monophyletic, the others were para- or polyphyletic. Although 15% of currently recognized species shared barcodes, the incidence of such taxa was far higher in regions exposed to Pleistocene glaciations than in those that were ice-free. Nearly 10% of species displayed high intraspecific variation (&gt;2.5%), suggesting the need for further investigation to assess potential cryptic diversity. Aside from aiding the identification of all life stages of North American butterflies, the reference library has provided new perspectives on the incidence of both cryptic and potentially over-split species, setting the stage for future studies that can further explore the evolutionary dynamics of this group.","['Paul D.N.

"Biodiversity research in tropical ecosystems—popularized as the most biodiverse habitats on Earth—often neglects invertebrates, yet invertebrates represent the bulk of local species richness. Insect communities in particular remain strongly impeded by both Linnaean and Wallacean shortfalls, and identifying species often remains a formidable challenge inhibiting the use of these organisms as indicators for ecological and conservation studies. Here we use DNA barcoding as an alternative to the traditional taxonomic approach for characterizing and comparing the diversity of moth communities in two different ecosystems in Gabon. Though sampling remains very incomplete, as evidenced by the high proportion (59%) of species represented by singletons, our results reveal an outstanding diversity. With about 3500 specimens sequenced and representing 1385 BINs (Barcode Index Numbers, used as a proxy to species) in 23 families, the diversity of moths in the two sites sampled is higher than the current number of species listed for the entire country, highlighting the huge gap in biodiversity knowledge for this country. Both seasonal and spatial turnovers are strikingly high (18.3% of BINs shared between seasons, and 13.3% between sites) and draw attention to the need to account for these when running regional surveys. Our results also highlight the richness and singularity of savannah environments and emphasize the status of Central African ecosystems as hotspots of biodiversity.","['Thibaud Decaëns', 'David Sebag', 'Nil Rahola', 'Richard Oslisly', 'Nicolas Moulin', 'Ghislain Moussavou', 'Jacques-François Mavoungou', 'Carlos Lopez-Vaamonde', 'Philippe Le Gall', 'Roger Kamgang', 'Paul D.N.

"DNA barcoding aims to accelerate species identification and discovery, but performance tests have shown marked differences in identification success. As a consequence, there remains a great need for comprehensive studies which objectively test the method in groups with a solid taxonomic framework. This study focuses on the 180 species of butterflies in Romania, accounting for about one third of the European butterfly fauna. This country includes five eco-regions, the highest of any in the European Union, and is a good representative for temperate areas. Morphology and DNA barcodes of more than 1300 specimens were carefully studied and compared. Our results indicate that 90 per cent of the species form barcode clusters allowing their reliable identification. The remaining cases involve nine closely related species pairs, some whose taxonomic status is controversial or that hybridize regularly. Interestingly, DNA barcoding was found to be the most effective identification tool, outperforming external morphology, and being slightly better than male genitalia. Romania is now the first country to have a comprehensive DNA barcode reference database for butterflies. Similar barcoding efforts based on comprehensive sampling of specific geographical regions can act as functional modules that will foster the early application of DNA barcoding while a global system is under development.","['Roger Vila', 'Paul D.

"Social ties are crucial for humans. Disruption of ties through social exclusion has a marked effect on our thoughts and feelings; however, such effects can be tempered by broader social network resources. Here, we use fMRI data acquired from 80 male adolescents to investigate how social exclusion modulates functional connectivity within and across brain networks involved in social pain and understanding the mental states of others (i.e., mentalizing). Furthermore, using objectively logged friendship network data, we examine how individual variability in brain reactivity to social exclusion relates to the density of participants’ friendship networks, an important aspect of social network structure. We find increased connectivity within a set of regions previously identified as a mentalizing system during exclusion relative to inclusion. These results are consistent across the regions of interest as well as a whole-brain analysis. Next, examining how social network characteristics are associated with task-based connectivity dynamics, we find that participants who showed greater changes in connectivity within the mentalizing system when socially excluded by peers had less dense friendship networks. This work provides insight to understand how distributed brain systems respond to social and emotional challenges and how such brain dynamics might vary based on broader social network characteristics.","['Emily B.

"The widespread of Coronavirus has led to a worldwide pandemic with a high mortality rate. Currently, the knowledge accumulated from different studies about this virus is very limited. Leveraging a wide-range of biological knowledge, such as gene on-tology and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks from other closely related species presents a vital approach to infer the molecular impact of a new species. In this paper, we propose the transferred multi-relational embedding model Bio-JOIE to capture the knowledge of gene ontology and PPI networks, which demonstrates superb capability in modeling the SARS-CoV-2-human protein interactions. Bio-JOIE jointly trains two model components. The knowledge model encodes the relational facts from the protein and GO domains into separated embedding spaces, using a hierarchy-aware encoding technique employed for the GO terms. On top of that, the transfer model learns a non-linear transformation to transfer the knowledge of PPIs and gene ontology annotations across their embedding spaces. By leveraging only structured knowledge, Bio-JOIE significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in PPI type prediction on multiple species. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the potential of leveraging the learned representations on clustering proteins with enzymatic function into enzyme commission families. Finally, we show that Bio-JOIE can accurately identify PPIs between the SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins, providing valuable insights for advancing research on this new disease.","['Wei Wang', 'Carlo Zaniolo', 'Yizhou Sun', 'Muhao Chen', 'Chelsea J-T Ju', 'Junheng Hao']",10.1101/2020.06.15.153692,http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.15.153692,0,2020,Bio-joie: Joint representation learning of biological knowledge bases,"Proceedings of the 11th ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology and Health Informatics","([],)",,Machine Learning

For instance, given an incomplete biological knowledge graph, we might want to predict ""em what drugs are likely to target proteins involved with both diseases X and Y?"" -- a query that requires reasoning about all possible proteins that might interact with diseases X and Y.

"Ontologies have long been employed in the life sciences to formally represent and reason over domain knowledge and they are employed in almost every major biological database. Recently, ontologies are increasingly being used to provide background knowledge in similarity-based analysis and machine learning models. The methods employed to combine ontologies and machine learning are still novel and actively being developed. We provide an overview over the methods that use ontologies to compute similarity and incorporate them in machine learning methods; in particular, we outline how semantic similarity measures and ontology embeddings can exploit the background knowledge in ontologies and how ontologies can provide constraints that improve machine learning models. The methods and experiments we describe are available as a set of executable notebooks, and we also provide a set of slides and additional resources at https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/machine-learning-with-ontologies.","['Robert Hoehndorf', 'Xin Gao', 'Fatima Zohra Smaili', 'Maxat Kulmanov']",10.1093/bib/bbaa199,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbaa199,0,2021,Semantic similarity and machine learning with ontologies,Briefings in bioinformatics,"(['Molecular Biology', 'Information Systems'],)",,Machine Learning
"Knowledge graph embedding models have gained significant attention in AI research. Recent works have shown that the inclusion of background knowledge, such as logical rules, can improve the performance of embeddings in downstream machine learning tasks. However, so far, most existing models do not allow the inclusion of rules. We address the challenge of including rules and present a new neural based embedding model (LogicENN). We prove that LogicENN can learn every ground truth of encoded rules in a knowledge graph. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been proved so far for the neural based family of embedding models.","['Hamed Shariat Yazdi', 'Jens Lehmann', 'Chengjin Xu', 'Mojtaba Nayyeri']",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.07141.pdf,8,2019,LogicENN: A Neural Based Knowledge Graphs Embedding Model with Logical Rules,ArXiv,,Computer Science,Machine Learning
"Semantic embedding of knowledge graphs has been widely studied and used for prediction and statistical analysis tasks across various domains such as Natural Language Processing and the Semantic Web. However, less attention has been paid to developing robust methods for embedding OWL (Web Ontology Language) ontologies, which contain richer semantic information than plain knowledge graphs, and have been widely adopted in domains such as bioinformatics. In this paper, we propose a random walk and word embedding based ontology embedding method named , which encodes the semantics of an OWL ontology by taking into account its graph structure, lexical information and logical constructors. Our empirical evaluation with three real world datasets suggests that   benefits from these three different aspects of an ontology in class membership prediction and class subsumption prediction tasks. Furthermore,   often significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in our experiments.","['Ian Horrocks', 'Denvar Antonyrajah', 'Ole Magnus Holter', 'Ernesto Jiménez-Ruiz', 'Pan Hu', 'Jiaoyan Chen']",10.1007/s10994-021-05997-6,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14654.pdf,0,2020,OWL2Vec*: Embedding of OWL Ontologies,CoRR,"(['Artificial Intelligence', 'Software'],)",,Machine Learning

"A consumer-dependent (business-to-consumer) organization tends to present itself as possessing a set of human qualities, which is termed the            brand personality            of the company. The perception is impressed upon the consumer through the content, be it in the form of advertisement, blogs, or magazines, produced by the organization. A consistent brand will generate trust and retain customers over time as they develop an affinity toward regularity and common patterns. However, maintaining a consistent messaging tone for a brand has become more challenging with the virtual explosion in the amount of content that needs to be authored and pushed to the Internet to maintain an edge in the era of digital marketing. To understand the depth of the problem, we collect around 300K web page content from around 650 companies. We develop trait-specific classification models by considering the linguistic features of the content. The classifier automatically identifies the web articles that are not consistent with the mission and vision of a company and further helps us to discover the conditions under which the consistency cannot be maintained. To address the brand inconsistency issue, we then develop a sentence ranking system that outputs the top three sentences that need to be changed for making a web article more consistent with the company’s brand personality.","['Niloy Ganguly', 'Anandhavelu Natarajan', 'Niyati Chhaya', 'Shamik Sural', 'Soumyadeep Roy']",10.1145/3450445,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3450445,5,2021,"An Integrated Approach for Improving Brand Consistency of Web Content: Modeling, Analysis, and Recommendation",ACM Transactions on the Web,"(['Computer Networks and Communications'],)",,Machine Learning

"Cold atmospheric-pressure plasmas are currently in use in medicine as surgical tools and are being evaluated for new applications, including wound treatment and cosmetic care. The disinfecting properties of plasmas are of particular interest, given the threat of antibiotic resistance to modern medicine. Plasma effluents comprise (V)UV photons and various reactive particles, such as accelerated ions and radicals, that modify biomolecules; however, a full understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie plasma-based disinfection has been lacking. Here, we investigate the antibacterial mechanisms of plasma, including the separate, additive and synergistic effects of plasma-generated (V)UV photons and particles at the cellular and molecular levels. Using scanning electron microscopy, we show that plasma-emitted particles cause physical damage to the cell envelope, whereas UV radiation does not. The lethal effects of the plasma effluent exceed the zone of physical damage. We demonstrate that both plasma-generated particles and (V)UV photons modify DNA nucleobases. The particles also induce breaks in the DNA backbone. The plasma effluent, and particularly the plasma-generated particles, also rapidly inactivate proteins in the cellular milieu. Thus, in addition to physical damage to the cellular envelope, modifications to DNA and proteins contribute to the bactericidal properties of cold atmospheric-pressure plasma.","['Julia E.
